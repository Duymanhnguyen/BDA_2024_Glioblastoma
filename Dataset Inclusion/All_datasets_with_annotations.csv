GSE71224,Inhibition of 13-cis retinoic acid-induced gene expression of reactive-resistance genes by thalidomide in glioblastoma tumours in vivo,9396,"The cell differentiation potential of 13-cis retinoic acid (RA) has not succeeded in the clinical treatment of glioblastoma (GBM) so far. However, RA may also induce the expression of disistance genes such as HOXB7 which can be suppressed by Thalidomide (THAL). Therefore, we tested if combined treatment with RA+THAL may inhibit growth of glioblastoma in vivo. Treatment with RA+THAL but not RA or THAL alone significantly inhibited tumour growth. The synergistic effect of RA and THAL was corroborated by the effect on proliferation of glioblastoma cell lines in vitro. HOXB7 was not upregulated but microarray analysis validated by real-time PCR identified four potential resistance genes (IL-8, HILDPA, IGFBPA, and ANGPTL4) whose upregulation by RA was suppressed by THAL. Furthermore, genes coding for small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNA) were identified as a target for RA for the first time, and their upregulation was maintained after combined treatment. Pathway analysis showed upregulation of the Ribosome pathway and downregulation of pathways associated with proliferation and inflammation. Combined treatment with RA + THAL delayed growth of GBM xenografts and suppressed putative resistance genes associated with hypoxia and angiogenesis. This encourages further pre-clinical and clinical studies of this drug combination in GBM.

GSE234762,Gene expression profiling and the isocitrate dehydrogenase mutational landscape of temozolomide-resistant glioblastoma,32522," Glioblastoma(GBM), an aggressive brain cancer, occurs frequently compared to other brain tumors. This study aimed to reveal the novel mechanism of temozolomide (TMZ) resistance (chemotherapeutic drug) Meta-Z analysis, Kaplan–Meier (KM) survival analysis, protein-protein interaction (PPI) network establishment, cluster analysis of co-expressed gene networks, and hierarchical clustering of all upregulated and downregulated genes were used. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (q-PCR) analysis revealed the downregulated (TIE1, CACNA2D1, CAPN6, and ADAMTS6) and upregulated (SAA1, SAA2, GDF15, and USP26) genes. Different statistical models were developed for these genes using the Z-score and the KM plot was depicted using a cohort of patient with brain tumors. The maximum number of nodes was observed in the PPI-network for ADAMTS6 and TIE1. The PPI network model of all genes showed 35 nodes and 241 edges. Immunohistochemical staining was performed using GBM with isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH)-wild-type or IDH-mutant samples and significant upregulation of TIE1 (p<0.001) and CAPN 6 (p<0.05) protein expression was found in IDH-mutant GBM. Structural analysis revealed the IDH-mutant model using mutant residues (R132, R140, and R172). The result of this study will aid the development of novel biomarkers and new therapeutics for brain tumors.

GSE162614,Activation of estrogen receptor beta signaling reduces stemness of glioma stem cells,35210," We examined the transcriptional changes altered by ERβ agonist LY500307 treatment in glioma stem cells (GSCs) by performing global transcriptome analysis. Patient-derived GBM cells (GSC-111010) were subjected to CD133 sorting, and isolated GSCs were treated with either vehicle or LY500307 (5 µM) for 24 h. The RNA was isolated and utilized for RNA-seq analysis. Our results demonstrated that the top pathway altered by LY500307 was the glutamate receptor pathway. Other pathways altered by LY500307 treatment include unfolded protein response, CREB signaling, death receptor signaling, PCP pathway, p53 signaling, and NRF2-mediated oxidative stress response which are known to be involved in stemness and apoptosis. Further, Gene Ontology (GO) analysis revealed that differentially expressed genes were enriched in biological processes, such as regulation of programmed cell death, glutamate receptor signaling pathway, cell communication, and response to unfolded protein. In terms of molecular function, the differentially expressed genes were mainly enriched in glutamate receptor activity, glutamate-gated and transmitter-gated ion channel activity.

GSE8692,Endogeneous mRNA level fluctuations in various brain tumor cells,5651,"Background:  microRNAs (miRNAs) are approximately 21 nucleotide non-coding transcripts capable of regulating gene expression.  The most widely studied mechanism of regulation involves binding of the miRNA to a target mRNA, usually in its 3’ untranslated region (UTR).  As a result, translation of the target mRNA is inhibited and sometimes the mRNA itself can be de-stabilized.  The inhibitory effects of miRNAs have been linked to many diverse cellular processes including malignant proliferation and apoptosis, development and differentiation, metabolic processes and neural plasticity.  We asked whether endogenous fluctuations in a set of mRNA and miRNA profiles contain correlated changes that are statistically distinguishable from the many other fluctuations in the data set.  Methodology/Principal Findings:  Biopsies from 12 human primary brain tumors were used to extract RNA.  These samples were used to determine genome-wide mRNA expression levels by microarray analysis and a miRNA profile by real-time reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR).  Correlation coefficients were determined for all possible mRNA-miRNA pairs and the distribution of these correlations compared to the random distribution.  An excess of high positive and negative correlation pairs were observed at the tails of these distributions.  Most of these highest correlation pairs do not contain sufficiently complementary sequences to predict a target relationship; nor do they lie in physical proximity to each other.  However, by examining pairs in which the significance of the correlation coefficients is modestly relaxed, negative correlations do tend to predict targets and positive correlations do tend to predict physically proximate pairs.  A subset of high correlation pairs were experimentally validated by over-expressing or suppressing a miRNA and measuring the correlated mRNAs.  Conclusions/Significance:  Sufficient information exists within a set of tumor samples to detect endogenous correlations between miRNA and mRNA levels.  Based on the validations of the correlations the causal arrow for these correlations is likely to be directed from the miRNAs to the mRNAs.  From these data sets, we inferred and validated a tumor suppression pathway linked to miR-181c.

GSE36245,Gene expression data from glioblastoma tumor samples,5768,"Glioblastoma (GBM) is an incurable brain tumor carrying a dismal prognosis, which displays considerable heterogeneity. We have recently identified recurrent H3F3A mutations affecting two critical positions of histone H3.3 (K27, G34) in one-third of pediatric GBM. Here we show that each of these H3F3A mutations defines an epigenetic subgroup of GBM with a distinct global methylation pattern, and are mutually exclusive with IDH1 mutation (characterizing a CpG-Island Methylator Phenotype (CIMP) subgroup). Three further epigenetic subgroups were enriched for hallmark genetic events of adult GBM (EGFR amplification, CDKN2A/B deletion) and/or known transcriptomic signatures. We also demonstrate that the two H3F3A mutations give rise to GBMs in separate anatomic compartments, with differential regulation of OLIG1/2 and FOXG1, possibly reflecting different cellular origins. To further dissect the biological differences between epigenetic glioblastoma subgroups, we looked at the transcriptomic profiles of glioblastoma samples.

Another critical unmet need is the ability to predict therapeutic responses for individual patients. Toward this goal, we have established a library of orthotopic glioblastoma (GBM) xenograft models using surgical samples of GBM patients. These patient-specific GBM xenograft tumors recapitulate histopathological properties and maintain genomic characteristics of parental GBMs in situ. Furthermore, in vivo irradiation, chemotherapy, and targeted therapy of these xenograft tumors mimic the treatment response of parental GBMs. We also found that establishment of orthotopic xenograft models portends poor prognosis of GBM patients and identified the gene signatures and pathways signatures associated with the clinical aggressiveness of GBMs. Together, the patient-specific orthotopic GBM xenograft library represent the preclinically and clinically valuable “patient tumor’s phenocopy” that represents molecular and functional heterogeneity of GBMs.

GSE44841,Microarray analysis of differentiation of human glioblastoma neurospheres,6130,"Brain tumor neurospheres (BTCSs) are cancer cells with neural stem cell-like properties found in the fatal brain tumor glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). These cells account for less than 1% of total tumor cells, are poorly differentiated and are believed to be involved in tumor induction, progression, treatment resistance and relapse. Specific miRNAs play important roles in modulating the proliferation and differentiation of neural stem cells, therefore, we aimed to identify miRNAs controlling differentiation in GBM-BTSCs through high throughput screening miRNA array profiling. We compared the miRNA expression profiles at the neurosphere state and upon 4 and 14days of differentiation by using LIMMA, finding 21 differentially expressed miRNAs : hsa-miR-103, hsa-miR-106a, hsa-miR-106b, hsa-miR-15b, hsa-miR-17, hsa-miR-19a, hsa-miR-20a, hsa-miR-25, hsa-miR-301a and hsa-miR-93 were found up-regulated upon differentiation, while hsa-miR-100, hsa-miR-1259, hsa-miR-21, hsa-miR-22, hsa-miR-221, hsa-miR-222, hsa-miR-23b, hsa-miR-27a, hsa-miR-27b, hsa-miR-29a and hsa-miR-29b were down-regulated. Expression of 11 of the 21 miRNAs was examined by qPCR and 7 of them were validated: hsa-miR-21, hsa-miR-29a, hsa-miR-29b, hsa-miR-221 and hsa-miR-222 increased their expression upon differentiation, while hsa-miR-93 and hsa-miR-106a were inhibited. Functional studies demonstrated that miR-21 over-expression induced the expression of glial and/or neuronal cell markers in the neurospheres, possibly due to SPRY1 targeting by miR-21 in these cells, while miR-221 and miR-222 inhibition at the differentiated state reduced the expression of those differentiation markers. On the other hand, miR-29a and miR-29b targeted MCL1 in the GBM neurospheres and increased apoptotic cell death.

GSE32374,Clinical and Molecular Characteristics of  Congenital Glioblastoma Multiforme,7487,"Congenital glioblastoma multiforme (cGBM) historically has been considered an aggressive tumor of infancy requiring extensive chemotherapy to achieve cure. We report on 4 patients at our institution with cGBMs who were treated with surgery and chemotherapy (carboplatin and etoposide every 21 days for 2-6 cycles).  Four of four patients are progression free at a median time of 27.5 months (22-103 months).  To characterize the molecular biology of cGBM, we compared the gene expression profiles of 3 cGBMs to 12 pediatric and 6 primary adult glioblastomas collected at our institution. Unsupervised hierarchical clustering showed cGBMs grouped together with other high-grade gliomas. cGBMs demonstrated marked similarity to both pediatric and adult GBMs, with only a total of 31 differentially expressed genes identified (FDR < 0.05). Unique molecular features of congenital GBMs identified included over-expression of multiple genes involved in glucose metabolism and tissue hypoxia pathways. Four tyrosine kinases were also mong the up-regulated genes (RET, RASGRF2, EFNA5, ALK). Thus, at our institution congenital GBMs, while similar both histologically and molecularly to other GBMs, appear to have a good prognosis with surgery in combination with relatively moderate chemotherapy. Further study is needed to determine if the few gene expression differences that were identified may contribute to the better survival seen in these tumors compared to pediatric or adult GBMs. Key Words: glioblastoma; congenital; pediatric; gene expression; microarray

GSE9385,Identification of differentially regulated splice variants and novel exons in glial brain tumors using exon arrays,8284,"Aberrant splice variants are involved in the initiation and/or progression of glial brain tumors. We therefore set out to identify splice variants that are differentially expressed between histological subgroups of gliomas. Splice variants were identified using a novel platform that profiles the expression of virtually all known and predicted exons present in the human genome. Exon-level expression profiling was performed on 26 glioblastomas, 22 oligodendrogliomas and 6 control brain samples. Our results demonstrate that Human Exon arrays can identify subgroups of gliomas based on their histological appearance and genetic aberrations. We next used our expression data to identify differentially expressed splice variants. In two independent approaches, we identified 49 and up to 459 exons that are differentially spliced between glioblastomas and oligodendrogliomas a subset of which (47% and 33%) were confirmed by RT-PCR. In addition, exon-level expression profiling also identified >700 novel exons. Expression of ~67% of these candidate novel exons was confirmed by RT-PCR. Our results indicate that exon-level expression profiling can be used to molecularly classify brain tumor subgroups, can identify differentially regulated splice variants and can identify novel exons. The splice variants identified by exon-level expression profiling may help to detect the genetic changes that cause or maintain gliomas and may serve as novel treatment targets.

GSE79735,RNA-seq Profiles in RBPJ Maintains Brain Tumor Initiating Cells through CDK9-mediated Transcriptional Elongation,9384,"Glioblastomas coopt stem cell regulatory pathways to maintain brain tumor initiating cells (BTICs), also known as cancer stem cells.  Notch signaling has been a molecular target in BTICs, but Notch antagonists have demonstrated limited efficacy in clinical trials.  RBPJ is considered a central transcriptional mediator of Notch activity. Here, we report that pharmacologic Notch inhibitors were less effective than targeting RBPJ in suppressing tumor growth. While Notch inhibitors decreased canonical Notch gene expression, RBPJ regulated a distinct profile of genes critical to BTIC stemness and cell cycle progression. RBPJ was preferentially expressed by BTICs and required for BTIC self-renewal and tumor growth. MYC, a key BTIC regulator, bound the RBPJ promoter and treatment with a BET family bromodomain inhibitor decreased MYC and RBPJ expression.  Proteomic studies demonstrated that RBPJ binds CDK9, a component of P-TEFb (positive transcription elongation factor), to target gene promoters, enhancing transcriptional elongation.  Collectively, RBPJ links MYC and transcriptional control through CDK9, providing potential nodes of fragility for therapeutic intervention, potentially distinct from Notch.

GSE105773,RNA editing in nascent RNA affects pre-mRNA splicing,16126," In eukaryotes, nascent RNA transcripts undergo an intricate series of RNA processing steps to achieve mRNA maturation. RNA editing and alternative splicing are two major RNA processing steps that can introduce significant modifications to the final gene products. By tackling these processes in isolation, recent studies have enabled substantial progress in understanding their global RNA targets and regulatory pathways. However, the interplay between individual steps of RNA processing, an essential aspect of gene regulation, remains poorly understood. By sequencing the RNA of different subcellular fractions, we examined the timing of adenosine-to-inosine (A-to-I) RNA editing and its impact on alternative splicing. We observed that > 90% A-to-I RNA editing events occurred in the chromatin-associated RNA prior to polyadenylation. We report about 500 editing sites in the 3’ acceptor sequences that can alter splicing of the associated exons. Interestingly, these exons are highly conserved during evolution and reside in genes with important cellular function. Furthermore, we identified a second class of exons whose splicing is likely modulated by RNA secondary structures that are recognized by the RNA editing machinery. The genome-wide analyses, supported by experimental validations, revealed remarkable interplay between RNA editing and splicing and expanded the repertoire of functional RNA editing sites.

GSE78025,Acute exposure to graded levels of hypoxia in U87-MG cells: the role of hypoxia in GBM,16432," Purpose: Hypoxia is a predominant feature in GBM and its microenvironment. It is associated with the tumor growth, progression and resistance to conventional therapy of GBM. We have utilized U87-MG cell line as a human GBM cell model and human brain HEB cell line as non-neoplastic brain cell cultured in different levels of hypoxia for transcriptional profiling to identify the transcriptional signature of U87-MG cells for elucidated the role of hypoxia in GBM phenotype. Methods: We have utilized U87-MG cell line as a human GBM cell model and human brain HEB cell line as non-neoplastic brain cell cultured in 21%, 5% and 1% O2 for 24h. Then we detected the changes of transcriptional profiling and analyzed the biological process and pathway for the genes with different expression modes in different hypoxia levels. Results: U87-MG cells present specific transcriptional signature response to different hypoxia levels. The genes associated with organ and system development present an upward trend from normoxia to extreme hypoxia. And the biological process of DNA repair presents a downward trend, indicating that gene mutations of U87-MG cells could derive by hypoxia microenvironment. Otherwise, HEB cells present the canonical response to hypoxia, reducing of the metabolic rate in concert with the degree of hypoxia and extracting more oxygen from the environment. Conclusion: Hypoxia microenvironment could promote the malignance of GBM through activate of genes involved in organ and system development. Meanwhile it could induce the mutations of genes in GBM, especially extreme hypoxia.

Interference with c-MET drives oxidative metabolism by increasing fatty acid oxidation (FAO) and glucose anaplerosis, which was orchestrated by the master-regulator, PGC1α. Based on a drug screen, we further found that the mitochondrial matrix chaperone inhibitor, gamitrinib, along with c-MET inhibition causes synergistic cell death, which was mechanistically related to the ability of gamitrinib to suppress oxidative metabolism. In alignment with these findings, FAO inhibitor, etomoxir, enhanced the anti-proliferative effects of c-MET inhibition as well. Both combination therapies were active in vivo, suggesting two novel potential combination therapies, involving c-MET inhibitors.

GSE182373,Evaluation of comprehensive gene expression and NK cell-mediated killing in glioblastoma cell line-derived spheroids [spheroids],20188," GBM is the most common and aggressive primary brain tumor with dismal prognosis. NK cells are large granular lymphocytes with natural cytotoxicity against tumor cells, and they should be established for the novel treatment against patients with GBM. We have previously reported highly activated and ex vivo-expanded NK cells derived from human peripheral blood, which is designated as Genuine-induced natural killer cell (GiNK), induced by our specific culture conditions exerted the cytotoxic effect on GBM cells via apoptosis. First, we comprehensively summarized the molecular characteristics, especially focusing on the expression of stem cell markers, extracellular matrix markers, chemokine, chemokine receptors, and the NK receptors’ ligands, of GBM spheroids compared with 2D adherent GBM cells by using microarray. In the spheroid derived from GBM cell lines, gene expression of stem cell markers, extracellular matrix markers, chemokine, chemokine receptor, NK cell inhibitory receptor’ ligand were up-regulated compared with 2D adherent GBM cells. A preclinical evaluation of the NK cells was performed by ex vivo 3D spheroid model derived from GBM cell lines. In 3D spheroid model, the NK cells accumulated and infiltrated around the spheroids and induced the GBM cell death. Flow cytometry-based apoptosis detection assay clearly showed that the NK cells induced the GBM cell death via apoptosis. Our findings could provide pivotal information for the NK cell based-immunotherapy to patients with GBM.

GSE135306,Targeting EYA2 tyrosine phosphatase activity in glioblastoma stem cells induces mitotic catastrophe,20370," Glioblastoma ranks among the most lethal of primary brain malignancies, with glioblastoma stem cells (GSCs) at the apex of tumor cellular hierarchies. Here, to discover novel therapeutic GSC targets, we interrogated gene expression profiles from GSCs, differentiated glioblastoma cells (DGCs), and neural stem cells (NSCs), revealing EYA2 as preferentially expressed by GSCs. Targeting EYA2 impaired GSC maintenance and induced cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, and loss of self-renewal. EYA2 displayed novel localization to centrosomes in GSCs, and EYA2 tyrosine (Tyr) phosphatase activity was essential for proper mitotic spindle assembly and survival of GSCs. Inhibition of the EYA2 Tyr phosphatase activity, via genetic or pharmacological means, mimicked EYA2 loss in GSCs in vitro and extended the survival of tumor-bearing mice. Supporting the clinical relevance of these findings, EYA2 portends poor patient prognosis in glioblastoma. Collectively, our data indicate that EYA2 phosphatase function plays selective critical roles in the growth and survival of GSCs, potentially offering a high therapeutic index for EYA2 inhibitors.

GSE149366,Glioblastoma stem cells after treatment with sulconazole.,20436," Glioblastoma (GBM) is a uniformly lethal disease that is driven by GBM stem cells (GSCs). However, methods that selectively eradicate the GSCs remain limited. Here, we employed a chemical biology approach to identify novel compounds and strategies that target GSC proliferation, invasiveness and stemness. We studied the effect of sulconazole (SN) previously reportedly known as an antifungal drug.  In GSCs SN inhibited multiple biotin-dependent carboxylases by competing with biotin, an important co-factor for these enzymes. Consequently, there was reduced carbon flux into the cholesterol biosynthesis and TCA cycle pathways, depleting intracellular cholesterol and impairing oxidative phosphorylation, resulting in impaired GSC proliferation. Notably, these metabolic changes were GSC-specific and undetected in SN treated mouse astrocytes. Thus, the pharmacologic inhibition of biotin-dependent carboxylases represents a viable therapy for GBM.

GSE180981,Transcriptional Control of Brain Tumour Stem Cells by a Carbohydrate Binding Protein,20465," Brain tumour stem cells (BTSCs) and intratumoural heterogeneity represent major challenges in glioblastoma therapy. Here, we report that the LGALS1 gene, encoding the carbohydrate binding protein, galectin1, is a key regulator of BTSCs and glioblastoma resistance to therapy. Genetic deletion of LGALS1 alters BTSC gene expression profiles and results in downregulation of gene sets associated with mesenchymal subtype of glioblastoma. Using a combination of pharmacological and genetic approaches, we establish that inhibition of LGALS1 signalling in BTSCs impairs self-renewal, suppresses tumourigenesis, prolongs lifespan, and improves glioblastoma response to ionizing radiation in preclinical animal models. Mechanistically, we show that LGALS1 is a direct transcriptional target of STAT3 with its expression robustly regulated by the ligand OSM. Importantly, we establish that galectin1 forms a complex with the transcription factor HOXA5 to reprogram BTSC transcriptional landscape. Our data unravel an oncogenic signalling pathway by which galectin1/HOXA5 complex maintains BTSCs and promotes glioblastoma.

GSE183606,Rutaecarpine inhibits glioblastoma migration by activating the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) signaling pathway,21252," Glioblastoma is the most frequent and aggressive primary astrocytoma in adults. The high migration ability of the tumor cells is an important reason for the high recurrence rate and poor prognosis of glioblastoma. Recently, emerging evidence has shown that the migration ability of glioblastoma cell was inhibited upon the activation of aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), suggesting potential anti-tumor effects of AhR agonists. Rutaecarpine is a natural compound with potential tumor therapeutic effects which can possibly bind to AhR. However, its effect on the migration of glioblastoma is unclear. Therefore, we aim to explore the effects of rutaecarpine on the migration of human glioblastoma cells U87 and the involvements of the AhR signaling pathway. The results showed that: (i) compared with other structural related alkaloids, like evodiamine and dehydroevodiamine, rutaecarpine was a more potent AhR activator, and has stronger inhibitory effect on the glioblastoma cell migration; (ii) rutaecarpine decreased the migration ability of U87 cells in an AhR-dependent manner; (iii) AhR mediated the expression of a tumor suppressor interleukin 24 (IL24) induced by rutaecarpine, and AhR-IL24 axis was involved in the anti-migratoryeffects of rutaecarpine on the glioblastoma. Besides IL24, other motility related genes were proposed to participate in the migration regulation process of rutaecarpine by RNA-Seq analysis. These data suggest that rutaecarpine is a natural AhR agonist that could inhibit the migration of glioblastomaandbe a potential candidate for developing therapeutic drug against glioblatoma.

GSE180465,Effect of the different isoforms of RPL22L1 protein on the transcriptome of human glioblastoma cells.,21263," Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is characterized by an exceptionally high intratumoral heterogeneity. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the origin of different GBM cell populations remain unclear. Here we found that the composition of ribosomes of GBM cells in the tumor core and edge differ due to alternative RNA splicing. The acidic pH in the core switches pre-mRNA splicing of the ribosomal gene RPL22L1 toward the RPL22L1b isoform. This allows cells to survive acidosis, increases stemness and correlates with worse patient outcome. Mechanistically, RPL22L1b promotes RNA splicing by binding to lncMALAT1 in the nucleus, resulting in its degradation. Contrarily, in the tumor edge region, RPL22L1a interacts with ribosomes in cytoplasm and upregulates translation of multiple mRNAs including TP53. We found that RPL22L1 isoform switch is regulated by SRSF4 and identified the compound, that inhibits this process and decreases tumor growth. These findings demonstrate how distinct GBM cell populations arise during tumor growth. Targeting this mechanism may decrease GBM heterogeneity and facilitate therapy.

GSE146358,The Dopamine Receptor Antagonist TFP Prevents Phenotype Conversion and Improves Survival in Mouse Models of Glioblastoma,23597," Glioblastoma is the deadliest adult brain cancer and all patients ultimately succumb to the disease. Radiation therapy (RT) provides survival benefit of 6 months over surgery alone but these results have not improved in decades. We report that radiation induces a glioma-initiating cell phenotype and identified trifluoperazine (TFP) as a compound that interferes with this phenotype conversion. TFP caused loss of radiation-induced Nanog mRNA expression, activation of GSK3 with consecutive post-translational reduction in p-Akt, Sox2 and -catenin protein levels. TFP did not alter the intrinsic radiation sensitivity of glioma-initiating cells (GICs). Continuous treatment with TFP and a single dose of radiation reduced the number of GICs in vivo and prolonged survival in syngeneic and patient-derived orthotopic xenograft (PDOX) mouse models of glioblastoma. Our findings suggest that combination of a dopamine receptor antagonist with radiation enhances the efficacy of RT in glioblastoma by preventing radiation-induced phenotype conversion of radiosensitive non-GICs into treatment resistant, induced GICs.

GSE195506,Effects of Ultra-short Pulsed Electric Fields exposure on Glioblastoma Cells,25167," Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), is the most common form of adult malignant brain tumor, highly heterogeneous and relatively resistant to therapy with a poor prognosis. As other cancers, GBM starts from a relatively small fraction of poorly differentiated and particularly aggressive cancer stem cells (CSCs), responsible for aberrant proliferation and invasion, rapidly spreading the tumor growth in the other parts of the central nervous system. Due to the extreme tumor heterogeneity, standard therapies (i.e., surgery, chemotherapy and radiotherapy) provide poor positive outcomes and cancers usually recur. Therefore, alternative approaches, possibly targeting CSCs, are necessary for searching effective therapeutic strategies against GBM. Among many emerging new therapeutic strategies, ultra-short pulsed electric fields (PEF) are considered extremely promising in cancer therapy and our previous results demonstrated the capability of a specific electric pulse protocol, characterized by a high pulse amplitude and a short duration, to selectively affect medulloblastoma CSCs preserving normal cells. Here, we tested the same exposure protocol to investigate the response of U87 GBM cells, and of U87-derived neurospheres. By analyzing different in vitro biological endpoints and taking advantage of transcriptomic and bioinformatics analyses, we found that, independently of CSCs content, PEF exposure affected cell proliferation and differentially regulated hypoxia, inflammation and P53/cell cycle checkpoints. PEF exposure also significantly reduced the clonogenic potential, reducing the ability to form new neurospheres, and inhibited the invasion potential. Importantly, exclusively in U87 neurospheres, PEF exposure changed the expression of stemness/differentiation genes. Our results, confirm this physical stimulus as a promising treatment to destabilize the extreme intra-tumoral GBM heterogeneity opening up the possibility to develop future therapeutic strategies mediated by PEF exposure.

GSE193495,The interplay between SRC kinase and Caspase-8 phosphorylation on Y380 sustains the aberrant activation of NFkB signaling and promotes angiogenesis and resistance to therapy in glioblastoma,26914," Caspase-8 is a cysteine protease that plays an essential role in apoptosis. Consistently with its canonical proapoptotic function, cancer cells may genetically or epigenetically downregulate its expression, or may dampen its enzymatic activity by promoting the expression of FLIP protein. However, unexpectedly, Caspase-8 expression is often retained in cancer even in the absence of FLIP up regulation, suggesting that alternative mechanisms may be exploited by cancer cells to cope with Caspase-8 expression. In this regard, we reported that SRC tyrosine kinase, which is aberrantly activated in many tumors, promotes Caspase-8 phosphorylation on Tyr380 and this event impairs Caspase-8 autoprocessing and full activation. Here, we investigated the significance of Caspase-8 expression in the modulation of gene expression in glioblastoma, a brain tumor where both Caspase-8 expression and SRC activity are often aberrantly upregulated. Transcriptomic analyses identified inflammatory response as a major target of Caspase-8 expression, and in particular, the NFkB signaling as one of the most affected pathways. More importantly, we could show that SRC kinase activity promotes Caspase-8 phosphorylation on Tyr380 in this context and that this event drives the assembly of a multiprotein complex that triggers NFkB activation, thereby inducing the expression of inflammatory and pro-angiogenetic factors. Moreover Caspase-8 phosphorylation on Tyr380 sustains neoangiogenesis and resistance to radiotherapy. In summary, our work identifies a novel interplay between SRC kinase and Caspase-8 that allows cancer cells to hijack Caspase-8 to sustain tumor growth.

GSE220083,CHRM3 is a novel prognostic factor of poor prognosis and promotes GBM progression via activation of oncogenic invasive growth factors,26985," Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most aggressive cancer in brain and contains a high mortality ratedue to lack of effective treatment strategy. Molecular mechanisms of GBM characteristic invasive growth are urgently need to improve the poor prognosis. Via single nuclear-sequences of primary and recurrent GBM samples, level of the M3 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (CHRM3) was significantly higher in recurrent samples. Moreover, immunohistochemical staining of an array of glioma samples showed that high levels of CHRM3 is correlated to poor prognosis of glioma, consistent with The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. Knockdown of CHRM3 retarded glioma cell growth and invasion. In vivo assay of orthotopic glioma animal model indicated that inhibition of CHRM3 significantly suppressed glioma progression with prolonged survival time. Transcriptome analysis revealed that CHRM3 knockdown significantly reduced array of classic factors involved in cancer invasive growth including MMP1/MMP3/MMP10/MMP12 and CXCL1/CXCL5/CXCL8. Taken together, our study identified that CHRM3 is a new and important factor of GBM progression via regulation of multiple oncogenic genes and these results provide a new biomarker for prognosis and therapy of GBM patients.

GSE102136,Single Copy Loss of Tet1 disrupts neural stem cell differentiation and enhances GBM aggressiveness,27914," Glioblastoma (GBM) is a highly aggressive brain tumor, characterized by poorly differentiated cells that drive disease growth and relapse. In contrast to normal neural stem cells (NSCs) which show a highly orderly process of differentiation, GBM precursors exhibit differentiation failure. In order to identify new mechanisms involved in neuronal differentiation that may have bearing on understanding GBM, we performed an unbiased phenotypic screen, utilizing a library of mouse embryonic stem cell (mESC) clones carrying 1307 unique variable length haplodeletions (altogether covering 25% of the mouse genome). We identified a series of haplodeletions that conferred failed neuronal differentiation following neural lineage specification.  Several hit clones contained a deletion on mouse chromosome 10, synteneic to human chromosome 10q, and included the Tet1 gene. Loss of a single allele of Tet1 was sufficient to confer the failed neuronal differentiation on mouse neural precursors by allowing stem cell programs to override early commitment steps leading to full reversion back to a stem cell state. By deleting TET1 in human GBM precursors, we show that loss of one allele of TET1 is sufficient to cause increased self renewal, decreased differentiation, and increased tumorigenicity, demonstrating TET1 to be a key target, along with PTEN, on 10q. Reduced TET1 dosage leads to global DNA hypermethylation and increased sensitivity to DNA methylation inhibitors, suggesting their application in a subset of GBMs.

GSE227802,Genome-wide activation of a glioma cancerous transcription program and super-enhancers by a single enhancer HOXDeRNA [RNA-seq],28052," A growing number of studies describe multiple functions of lncRNAs in chromatin that support their active roles in normal and disease-specific gene expression. We identified a specific enhancer-associated LINC01116 (named HOXDeRNA), which targeted activation transformed human astrocytes into glioma-like cells. Using a combination of RNA-Seq, ChIRP-Seq, and ChIP-Seq, we defined the transcriptomic and epigenetic changes underlying the transformation. We demonstrate that HOXDeRNA binds in trans to the promoters of 44 glioma-specific transcription factors distributed throughout the genome and derepresses them by removing the Polycomb 2 complex. This process is mediated by the RNA G-quadruplex structure of HOXDeRNA. Moreover, HOXDeRNA-induced astrocyte transformation is accompanied by the activation of glioma-specific super-enhancers enriched for binding sites of glioma master transcription factors SOX2 and OLIG2, and multiple oncogenes such as EGFR, PDGFR, BRAF, and miR-21. Our results help reconstruct the sequence of events underlying the process of astrocyte transformation and suggest a driving role of HOXDeRNA eRNA in gliomagenesis.

GSE221971,PRMT6-CDC20 facilitates glioblastoma progression via the degradation of CDKN1B,28055," PRMT6, a type I arginine methyltransferase, di-methylates the arginine residues of both histones and non-histones asymmetrically. Increasing evidence indicates that PRMT6 plays a tumor mediator involved in human malignancies. Here, we aim to uncover the essential role and underlying mechanisms of PRMT6 in promoting glioblastoma (GBM) proliferation. Investigation of PRMT6 expression in glioma tissues demonstrated that PRMT6 is overexpressed, and elevated expression of PRMT6 is negatively correlated with poor prognosis in glioma/GBM patients. Silencing PRMT6 inhibited GBM cell proliferation and induced cell cycle arrest at the G0/G1 phase, while overexpressing PRMT6 had opposite results. Further, we found that PRMT6 attenuates the protein stability of CDKN1B by promoting its degradation. Subsequent mechanistic investigations showed that PRMT6 maintains the transcription of CDC20 by activating histone methylation mark (H3R2me2a), and CDC20 interacts with and destabilizes CDKN1B. Rescue experimental results confirmed that PRMT6 promotes the ubiquitinated degradation of CDKN1B and cell proliferation via CDC20. We also verified that the PRMT6 inhibitor (EPZ020411) could attenuate the proliferative effect of GBM cells. Our findings illustrate that PRMT6, an epigenetic mediator, promotes CDC20 transcription via H3R2me2a to mediate the degradation of CDKN1B to facilitate GBM progression. Targeting PRMT6-CDC20-CDKN1B axis might be a promising therapeutic strategy for GBM.

GSE216626,Glioblastoma and Cerebral Organoids: Development and Analysis of in vitro Model for Glioblastoma Migration,28213," It is currently challenging to adequately model the growth and migration of glioblastoma using 2D in vitro culture systems as they quickly lose the original, patient-specific identity and heterogeneity. However, with the advent of 3D cell cultures and human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs)-derived cerebral organoids (COs), studies demonstrate that the glioblastoma-cerebral organoid (GLICO) co-culture model helps to preserve the phenotype of the patient-specific tissue. Here we aimed to set up such a model using mature COs and develop a pipeline for subsequent analysis of co-cultured glioblastoma. Our data demonstrates that the growth and migration of the glioblastoma cell line within the mature COs are significantly increased in the presence of extracellular matrix proteins, shortening the time needed for glioblastoma to initiate migration. We also describe in detail the method for the visualization and quantification of these migrating cells within the GLICO model. Lastly, we show that this co-culture model (and the human brain-like microenvironment) can significantly transform the gene expression profile of the established U87 glioblastoma cell line into proneural and classical glioblastoma cell types.

GSE217366,Anti-seed PNAs targeting multiple oncomiRs for brain tumor therapy,28243," Glioblastoma (GBM) is one of the most lethal malignancies in the United States with poor survival and high recurrence rates, suggesting the need for approaches targeting the most important molecular drivers of tumor growth. Here, we aimed to simultaneously target oncomiRs 10b and 21, which have been reported to drive the aggressive growth and invasiveness of GBM. We designed short (8-mer bases) gamma-(g)-modified peptide nucleic acids (sPNAs), which target the seed region of oncomiRs 10b and 21 with high affinity. We entrapped these anti-miR sgPNAs in nanoparticles (NPs) formed from a block copolymer of poly(lactic acid) and hyperbranched polyglycerol (PLA-HPG). The surfaces of the NPs were functionalized with aldehydes to produce bioadhesive NPs: we have previously shown that these bioadhesive NPs (BNPs) produce superior transfection efficiency, with a tropism for tumor cells. The sgPNA BNPs showed superior anti-miR efficacy in comparison to the regular full length PNA BNPs in vitro. When combined with temozolomide, sgPNABNPs administered via convection-enhanced delivery (CED) inhibited the growth of intracranial tumors and significantly improved the survival of animals (>120 days). RNA sequencing analysis revealed the downregulation of multiple genes associated with PI3-Akt, focal adhesion, and hypoxia inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) pathway to inhibit GBM progression after simultaneous inhibition of oncomiRs 10b and 21. Hence, we established that BNPs loaded with anti-seed sgPNAstargeting multiple oncomiRs is a promising approach to improve the treatment of GBM, with a potential to personalize treatment based on tumor specific oncomiRs.

GSE116414,AffymetrixHuman Gene 2.0 ST Array,28719," Gene expression in glioblastoma cells from patients before treatment. The cells were inhibited or not for FGFR1. Glioblastoma are known to be aggressive and therapy-resistant tumors, due to the presence of glioblastoma stem cells (GSC) inside this heterogeneous tumor. We investigate here the involvement of FGFR1 in glioblastoma stem-like cells (GSLC) radioresistance mechanisms. We first demonstrated that the survival after irradiation was significantly diminished in FGFR1-silenced (FGFR1-) GSLC compared to control GSLC. The transcriptome analysis of GSLCs FGFR1(-) showed that FOX family members are differentially regulated by FGFR1 inhibition, particularly with an upregulation of FOXN3 and a downregulation of FOXM1.  GSLC survival after irradiation was significantly increased after FOXN3 silencing and decreased after FOXM1 inhibition, showing opposite effects of FGFR1/FOX family members on cell response to ionizing radiation. Silencing FGFR1 or FOXM1 downregulated genes involved in mesenchymal transition such as GLI2, TWIST1, and ZEB1 in GSC. It also dramatically reduced GSLC migration, strongly suggesting that FGFR1/FOXM1 pathway which regulates GSLC radioresistance. Databases analysis confirmed that the combined expression of FGFR1/FOXM1/MELK/GLI2/ZEB1/TWIST1 is significantly associated with patients overall survival after chemo-radiotherapy treatment. All these results, associated with our previous conduced ones with differentiated cells, clearly established that FGFR1-FOXM1 dependent GSC radioresistance pathway is a central actor of GBM treatment resistance and a key target to inhibit in the aim to increase the sensitivity of GBM to the radiotherapy.

GSE134973,Targeting Glioblastoma Stem Cells through Disruption of the Circadian Clock [RNA-Seq],29151," Glioblastomas are highly lethal cancers, containing self-renewing glioblastoma stem cells (GSCs). Here, we show that GSCs, differentiated glioblastoma cells (DGCs), and normal brain cultures all displayed robust circadian rhythms, yet GSCs alone displayed exquisite dependence on core clock transcription factors, BMAL1 and CLOCK, for optimal cell growth. Downregulation of BMAL1 or CLOCK in GSCs induced cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Chromatin immunoprecipitation revealed BMAL1 preferentially bound at metabolic genes in GSCs, associated with differences in active chromatin regions compared to NSCs. Targeting BMAL1 or CLOCK attenuated mitochondrial metabolic function and reduced expression of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle enzymes. Small molecule agonists of two independent BMAL1::CLOCK negative regulators, the Cryptochromes and REV-ERBs, downregulated stem cell factors and reduced GSC growth. Combination of Cryptochrome and REV-ERB agonists induced synergistic anti-tumor efficacy. Collectively, GSCs coopt circadian regulators beyond canonical circadian circuitry to promote stemness maintenance and metabolism, offering novel therapeutic paradigms.

GSE185955,Glioblastoma Stem Cells Reprogram Chromatin In Vivo To Generate Selective Therapeutic Dependencies [RNA-Seq],29763," Glioblastomas are universally fatal cancers that contain self-renewing glioblastoma stem cells (GSCs) that initiate tumors. Traditional anti-cancer drug discovery based on in vitro cultures tends to identify targets with poor therapeutic index and fails to accurately model the effects of the tumor microenvironment. Here, leveraging in vivo genetic screening, we identified the H3K4me3 regulator DPY30 as an in vivo-specific glioblastoma dependency. Based on the hypothesis that in vivo epigenetic regulation may define critical GSC dependencies, we interrogated active chromatin landscapes of GSCs derived from intracranial xenografts and cell culture through Histone H3 lysine 4 trimethylation (H3K4me3) chromatin immunoprecipitation and transcriptome analysis. Intracranial-specific genes marked by H3K4me3 included FOS, NFkB, and phosphodiesterase family members. In intracranial tumors, DPY30 regulated angiogenesis and hypoxia pathways in an H3K4me3-dependent manner, but was dispensable in cultured GSCs. PDE4B was a key downstream effector of DPY30; the PDE4 inhibitor, rolipram, preferentially targeted DPY30-expressing cells and impaired in vivo glioblastoma growth without affecting cultured tumor cells. Collectively, DPY30 selectively regulates H3K4me3 modification on genes critical to support angiogenesis and tumor growth in vivo, laying the foundation for the DPY30-PDE4B axis as a specific and novel therapeutic target in glioblastoma with a broad therapeutic index.

GSE162429,STAT3 enhances sensitivity of glioblastoma to drug-induced autophagy-dependent lysosomal cell death,30226," Glioblastoma (GBM) is a devastating disease and the most common primary brain malignancy of adults with a median survival barely exceeding one year. Recent findings suggest that the antipsychotic drug pimozide triggers an autophagy-dependent, lysosomal type of cell death in GBM cells with possible implications for GBM therapy. One oncoprotein that is often overactivated in these tumors and associated with a particularly dismal prognosis is Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription 3 (STAT3). Here, we used isogenic human GBM knockout cell lines, advanced fluorescence microscopy, transcriptomic analysis and FACS-based assessment of cell viability to show that STAT3 has an underappreciated, context-dependent role in drug-induced cell death. Specifically, we demonstrate that depletion of STAT3 significantly enhances cell survival after treatment with pimozide, suggesting that STAT3 confers a particular vulnerability to GBM. Furthermore, we show that active STAT3 has no major influence on the early steps of the autophagy pathway, but exacerbates drug-induced lysosomal membrane permeabilisation (LMP) and release of cathepsins into the cytosol. Collectively, our findings support the concept of exploiting the pro-death functions of autophagy and LMP for GBM therapy and to further determine whether STAT3 can be employed as a treatment predictor for highly apoptosis-resistant, but autophagy-proficient cancers.

GSE100398,Gene Expression Profile of ING5-knockdown Brain Tumor Initiating Cell Lines,30463," Transcriptome analysis on ING5-knockdown brain tumor stem cell lines Stem cell-like brain tumor initiating cells (BTICs) cause recurrence of glioblastomas, with BTIC ""stemness"" affected by epigenetic mechanisms. The ING family of epigenetic regulators (ING1-5) function by targeting histone acetyltransferase (HAT) or histone deacetylase (HDAC) complexes to the H3K4me3 mark to alter histone acetylation and subsequently, gene expression. Here we find that ectopic expression of ING5, the targeting subunit of HBO1, MOZ and MORF HAT complexes increases expression of the Oct4, Olig2 and Nestin stem cell markers, promotes self-renewal, prevents lineage differentiation and increases stem cell pools in BTIC populations. This activity requires the plant homeodomain region of ING5 that interacts specifically with the H3K4me3 mark. ING5 also enhances PI3K/AKT and MEK/ERK activity to sustain self-renewal of BTICs over serial passage of stem cell-like spheres. ING5 exerts these effects by activating transcription of calcium channel and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) pathway genes. In silico analyses of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data suggest that ING5 is a positive regulator of BTIC stemness, whose expression negatively correlates with patient prognosis, especially in the Proneural and Classical subtypes, and in tumors with low SOX2 expression. These data suggest that altering histone acetylation status and signaling pathways induced by ING5 may provide useful clinical strategies to target tumor resistance and recurrence in glioblastoma.

GSE245854,Lactate Reprograms Glioblastoma Immunity through CBX3-regulated Histone Lactylation [RNA-seq],31713," Glioblastoma (GBM), an aggressive brain malignancy with a cellular hierarchy dominated by GBM stem cells (GSCs), evades anti-tumor immunity through mechanisms that remain incompletely understood. Like most cancers, GBMs undergo metabolic reprogramming towards glycolysis to generate lactate. Here, we show that lactate production by patient-derived GSCs and microglia induces tumor cell epigenetic reprogramming through histone lactylation, an activating modification that leads to immunosuppressive transcriptional programs and suppression of microglial phagocytosis via transcriptional upregulation of CD47, a “don’t eat me” signal, in GBM cells. Leveraging these findings, pharmacologic targeting of lactate production augments efficacy of anti-CD47 therapy. Mechanistically, lactylated histone interacts with the heterochromatin component chromobox protein homolog 3 (CBX3). Although CBX3 does not possess direct lactyltransferase activity, CBX3 binds histone acetyltransferase (HAT) P300 to induce increased P300 substrate specificity toward lactyl-coA and a transcriptional shift toward an immunosuppressive cytokine profile. Targeting CBX3 inhibits tumor growth by both tumor cell-intrinsic mechanisms and increased tumor cell phagocytosis. Collectively, these results suggest that lactate mediates a metabolism-induced epigenetic reprogramming in GBM that contributes to CD47-dependent immune evasion, which can be leveraged to augment efficacy of immune-oncology therapies.

GSE245635,Hypoxia-induced circPLOD2a/b promote migration and invasion of GBM cells via suppressing XIRP1 through binding to HuR [2],31725," Background. Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most lethal form of brain tumors in human adults, and hypoxia is a common microenvironment in this disease. Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are identified as regulators in cancers including GBM. However, the specific roles of circRNAs in GBM under hypoxic condition remains elusive. Methods. RNA-seq was employed to investigate the expression profile of circRNAs in U87 cells under normoxia and hypoxia. Two circRNAs spliced from the same parental gene, named as circPLOD2a and circPLOD2b, were identified as hypoxia-responsive circRNAs, whose circular structures were verified by, qRT-PCR, RNase R digesting and Sanger sequencing in U87. Knockdown and overexpression of circPLOD2a/b in GBM cells were used to investigate the biological functions of these two circRNAs on tumor progression. Fluorescence in situ hybridization, RNA-pull down, mass spectrometry and RNA immunoprecipitation assays were conducted to explore the interactions between circPLOD2a/b, human antigen R (HuR), xin actin binding repeat containing 1 (XIRP1). Results. CircPLOD2a/b were significantly up-regulated in hypoxic GBM cells and directly induced by HIF1α under hypoxia. Overexpression of circPLOD2a/b enhance GBM cell invasion and migration, which could be inhibited by circPOD2a/b knockdown. Mechanistically, circPLOD2a/b competitively bind to HuR, inhibiting the interaction between HuR and XIRP1, thus promoting the tumor aggressiveness in GBM both in vitro and in vivo through down-regulating XIRP1.

GSE245634,Hypoxia-induced circPLOD2a/b promote migration and invasion of GBM cells via suppressing XIRP1 through binding to HuR [1],31726," Background. Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most lethal form of brain tumors in human adults, and hypoxia is a common microenvironment in this disease. Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are identified as regulators in cancers including GBM. However, the specific roles of circRNAs in GBM under hypoxic condition remains elusive. Methods. RNA-seq was employed to investigate the expression profile of circRNAs in U87 cells under normoxia and hypoxia. Two circRNAs spliced from the same parental gene, named as circPLOD2a and circPLOD2b, were identified as hypoxia-responsive circRNAs, whose circular structures were verified by, qRT-PCR, RNase R digesting and Sanger sequencing in U87. Knockdown and overexpression of circPLOD2a/b in GBM cells were used to investigate the biological functions of these two circRNAs on tumor progression. Fluorescence in situ hybridization, RNA-pull down, mass spectrometry and RNA immunoprecipitation assays were conducted to explore the interactions between circPLOD2a/b, human antigen R (HuR), xin actin binding repeat containing 1 (XIRP1). Results. CircPLOD2a/b were significantly up-regulated in hypoxic GBM cells and directly induced by HIF1α under hypoxia. Overexpression of circPLOD2a/b enhance GBM cell invasion and migration, which could be inhibited by circPOD2a/b knockdown. Mechanistically, circPLOD2a/b competitively bind to HuR, inhibiting the interaction between HuR and XIRP1, thus promoting the tumor aggressiveness in GBM both in vitro and in vivo through down-regulating XIRP1.  Conclusions. Hypoxia-induced circPLOD2a/b were identified as key regulators of migration and invasion in GBM cells, and act as oncogenic circRNAs to attenuate the interaction between HuR and XIRP1, which may be potential therapeutic strategy for GBM treatment.

GSE245624,RAPID RESISTANCE TO BET INHIBITORS IS MEDIATED BY FGFR1 IN GLIOBLASTOMA,31727," Bromodomain and extra-terminal domain (BET) proteins are therapeutic targets in several cancers including the most common malignant adult brain tumor glioblastoma (GBM). Multiple small molecule inhibitors of BET proteins have been utilized in preclinical and clinical studies. Unfortunately, BET inhibitors have not shown efficacy in clinical trials enrolling GBM patients. One possible reason for this may stem from resistance mechanisms that arise after prolonged treatment within a clinical setting. However, the mechanisms and timeframe of resistance to BET inhibitors in GBM is not known. To identify the temporal order of resistance mechanisms in GBM we performed quantitative proteomics using multiplex-inhibitor bead mass spectrometry and demonstrated that intrinsic resistance to BET inhibitors in GBM treatment occurs rapidly within hours and involves the fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1) protein. Additionally, small molecule inhibition of BET proteins and FGFR1 simultaneously induces synergy in reducing GBM tumor growth in vitro and in vivo. Further, FGFR1 knockdown synergizes with BET inhibitor mediated reduction of GBM cell proliferation. Collectively, our studies suggest that co-targeting BET and FGFR1 may dampen resistance mechanisms to yield a clinical response in GBM.

GSE234473,"O-GlcNAc transferase promotes glioblastoma through genes responsible for cell survival, invasion and inflammation",31730," Metabolic reprogramming has emerged as one of the key hallmarks of cancer cells. Various metabolic pathways are dysregulated in cancers including hexosamine biosynthesis pathway (HBP). Protein O-GlcNAcylation catalyzed by O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT), the effector of HBP is found to be upregulated in most cancers. Post-translational O-GlcNAcylation of various signaling and transcriptional regulators could promote cancer cell maintenance and progression through protein stability and gene expression regulation. Indeed, among majority of O-GlcNAcylated proteins are gene specific transcription factors and chromatin regulators. Therefore, investigating the role of OGT in particular types of cancers is crucial. Here, we have investigated the role of OGT in glioblastoma. OGT knockdown and chemical inhibition led to reduced glioblastoma cell proliferation and downregulation of many genes known to play key roles in glioblastoma cell proliferation, migration and invasion.We knocked down OGT and OGA enzyme expression by shRNAs followed by RNA sequencing was carried.

GSE186392,Clemastine suppresses proneural glioblastoma stem cell growth II,31794," Glioblastoma (GBM) cells’ stemness-like features and lineage plasticity promote tumor progression. Here, we demonstrate that Clemastine, a drug for treating hay fever and allergy symptoms, effectively attenuated the stemness and suppressed the propagation of primary GBM cultures bearing PDGFRA amplification. We show that these effects of GBM cells were accompanied by altered gene expression profiling indicative of a more differentiated state of tumor cells, in resonating with Clemastine’s activity in promoting the differentiation of normal oligodendrocyte progenitors (OPCs) into mature oligodendrocyte. Functional assays for proteins that can be pharmacologically targeted by Clemastine, including histamine receptors, muscarinic receptors, and Emopamil binding protein (EBP), revealed the essential roles of these proteins in sustaining GBM cell propagation and suggested that Clemastine likely impairs tumor cells via targeting multiple pathways. Finally, we showed that a PDGFB-driven mouse glioma model, representing the proneural subtype GBMs, was similarly susceptible to Clemastine treatment. Collectively, these results identify pathways that are essential for maintaining the proneural progenitor features of GBMs, and suggest that non-oncology, low toxicity drugs with OPC differentiation promoting effects, such as Clemastine, can be exploited for targeting GBM cell’s progenitor property.

GSE226700,Collagen VI sustains cell stemness and chemotherapy resistance in glioblastoma.,31965," Microenvironmental factors are known fundamentals regulators of the phenotype and aggressiveness of glioblastoma (GBM), the most lethal brain tumor, characterized by fast progression and marked resistance to treatments. In this context, the extracellular matrix (ECM) is known to heavily influence the behavior of cancer cells from several origins, contributing to stem cell niches, influencing tumor invasiveness and response to chemotherapy, mediating survival signaling cascades, and modulating inflammatory cell recruitment.  Here we show that collagen VI (COL6), an ECM protein widely expressed in both normal and pathological tissues, has a distinctive distribution within the GBM mass, strongly correlating with the most aggressive and phenotypically immature cells. Our data demonstrate that COL6 sustains the stem-like properties of GBM cells and supports the maintenance of an aggressive transcriptional program promoting cancer cell proliferation and survival. In particular, we identified a specific subset of COL6-transcriptionally regulated genes, required for the response of cells to replicative stress and DNA damage, supporting the concept that COL6 is an essential stimulus for the activation of GBM cell response and resistance to chemotherapy, through the ATM/ATR axis.  Altogether, these findings indicate that COL6 plays a pivotal role in GBM tumor biology, exerting a pleiotropic action across different GBM hallmarks, including phenotypic identity and gene transcription, as well as response to treatments, thus providing valuable information for the understanding of the complex microenvironmental cues underlying GBM malignancy. Collagen VI is over-expressed in the cancer stem cell niche in glioblastoma and protects them from differentiation stimuli and chemotherapy exposure.

GSE230453,Translocator protein (18kDA) (TSPO) marks mesenchymal glioblastoma cell populations characterized by elevated numbers of tumor-associated macrophages,32035," TSPO is a promising novel tracer target for positron-emission tomography (PET) imaging of brain tumors. However, due to the heterogeneity of cell populations that contribute to the TSPO-PET signal, imaging interpretation may be challenging. We therefore evaluated TSPO enrichment/expression in connection with its underlying histopathological and molecular features in gliomas. We analyzed TSPO expression and its regulatory mechanisms in large in silico datasets and by performing direct bisulfite sequencing of the TSPO promotor. In glioblastoma tissue samples of our TSPO-PET imaging study cohort, we dissected the association of TSPO tracer enrichment and protein labeling with the expression of cell lineage markers by immunohistochemistry and fluorescence multiplex stains. Furthermore, we identified relevant TSPO-associated signaling pathways by RNA sequencing. We found that TSPO expression is associated with prognostically unfavorable glioma phenotypes and that TSPO promotor hypermethylation is linked to IDH mutation. Careful histological analysis revealed that TSPO immunohistochemistry correlates with the TSPO-PET signal and that TSPO is expressed by diverse cell populations. While tumor core areas are the major contributor to the overall TSPO signal, TSPO signals in the tumor rim are mainly driven by CD68-positive microglia/macrophages. Molecularly, high TSPO expression marks prognostically unfavorable glioblastoma cell subpopulations characterized by an enrichment of mesenchymal gene sets and higher amounts of tumor-associated macrophages. In conclusion, our study improves the understanding of TSPO as an imaging marker in gliomas by unveiling IDH-dependent differences in TSPO expression/regulation, regional heterogeneity of the TSPO PET signal and functional implications of TSPO in terms of tumor immune cell interactions.

GSE240516,CCDC50 promotes glioblastoma progression through regulating EGFR cell-surface recycle,32104," Glioblastomas (GBM) are a kind of malignant tumor with high mortality. However, the mechanism of tumor progression remains poorly understood. Specifically, we find that the expression of autolysosome-associated protein CCDC50, is positively correlated with tumor malignancy, and poor survival of GBM patients. CCDC50 functions as a specific cargo adaptor to assist EGFR recycling back to the plasma membrane, leading to prolonged activation of the downstream signaling pathways. We reveal that targeting CCDC50 in GBM may be a promising therapeutic strategy, as CCDC50 deficiency significantly inhibited the proliferation and migration of tumor cells in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, targeting CCDC50 together with alkylating agent temozolomide (TMZ) induces synergistic function in regression of GBM tumors, representing an alternative strategy for malignant tumor therapy. We performed transcriptome profiling (RNA-seq) and quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT–PCR) in shCtrl and shCCDC50 cells to evaluate the GBM tumor growth and metastasis controlled by CCDC50.

GSE155808,The DYRK1A protein kinase is recruited to a subset of ribosomal protein gene promoters in human and mouse cells [RNA-seq],32306," Ribosomal protein genes (RPGs) coding sequences are highly conserved along evolution; however, promoter features and the machinery involved in their transcriptional regulation are not. In eukaryotes, the main genomic elements and players involved in RPG transcriptional regulation have been mostly characterized in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. However, given the lack of evolutionary conservation of the yeast factors, studies in higher eukaryotes have focused on searching for differential enrichment of transcription factor-binding motifs within the RPG promoters. Among them, the palindromic motif TCTCGCGAGA, which is currently acknowledged as a ZBTB33/KAISO motif, also matches the genomic sequence bound by the protein kinase DYRK1A. DYRK1A, a member of the human family of DYRK kinases, fulfills many diverse functions by phosphorylating a broad set of proteins involved in different cellular processes. One of such functions is to be a chromatin-associated kinase capable of regulating gene expression. Here, we analyze in-depth the presence of DYRK1A at the promoters of human and mouse RPGs and explore its functional consequences. Our results indicate that DYRK1A is a positive regulator of RPGs’ expression at the transcriptional level, and further expand the functional spectrum of the kinase as a contributor to the regulation of cell growth in mammalian cells.

GSE236486,Repression of ARNT2 Maintains Stemness and Limits Differentiation of Glioblastoma Cells,32403," To facilitate tumor growth, cancer cells activate pathways that enhance cell proliferation and suppress pathways responsible for cell differentiation. While the pathways involved in metabolic reprogramming and cell cycle progression in tumors have been extensively studied and understood, knowledge regarding the pathways that influence the differentiation status of cancer cells is limited. Our  study  characterizes  a  new  mechanism  regulating  the  balance  between  proliferation  and differentiation involving the repression of the neuronal-specific transcription factor ARNT2 by the MYC oncogene.  We found that MYC represses the transcription of ARNT2 via the activity of the polycomb complex 2. ARNT2 is reduced in glioblastoma and its levels are inversely correlated with patient survival. Using in vitro and in vivo models, we demonstrate that knocking out ARNT2 has no effect on the growth of glioblastoma cells in vitro, but dramatically increases glioblastoma cell growth in vivo, and overexpression of ARNT2 blunts the growth of fully transformed glioblastoma cells in vivo, with no effects in vitro. Mechanistically, we also confirmed that ARNT2 is required for neuronal differentiation including of human pluripotent stem cells. Our findings provide new insights into the complex mechanisms used by oncogenes to limit differentiation in cancer cells and define ARNT2 as a potential tumor suppressor gene in glioblastoma.

Specifically, CDK7 inhibition elicited an increase of oxygen consumption rate fueled by enhanced fatty acid oxidation (FAO) manifested by enhanced labeling of citric acid cycle intermediates from palmitic acid. Consistently, the combination treatment of CDK7 inhibitors with blockers of FAO (etomoxir) exerted substantial synergistic growth inhibition in patient derived xenograft as well as neurosphere GBM cultures, which was mainly driven by a collapse of oxidative energy metabolism. In turn, exogenous administration of adenosine triphosphate partially rescued from the cell death induced by the combination treatment. Finally, the combined administration of YKL-5-124 and etomoxir extended overall in an orthotopic patient-derived xenograft model of GBM. In summary, these data support that simultaneous targeting of CDK7 and FAO might be a potential novel therapy against GBM.

GSE111571,"YAP and MRTF-A, transcriptional co-activators of RhoA- mediated gene expression, are critical for glioblastoma tumorigenicity",32700," The role of YAP (Yes associated protein 1 gene) and MRTF-A (Megakaryoblastic Leukemia gene, MLK1), two transcriptional co-activators regulated downstream of GPCRs (G-protein coupled receptor) and RhoA, in growth of glioblastoma cells and in vivo GBM tumor development was explored using human glioblastoma cell lines  (1321N1) and tumor initiating cells derived from patient derived xenografts (PDX)PDX (GSC-23) cells. Knockdown of these co-activators in PDX cells using shRNA significantly attenuated in vitro proliferation and stemness assessed by limiting dilution and neurosphere formation. Orthotopic xenografts of the MRTF-A and YAP knockdown PDX cells formed significantly smaller tumors with lower morbidity than wild-type cells. In vitro studies of cellular responses to the GPCR agonist sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) demonstrated that YAP was required for glioblastoma cell invasion and migration, whereas MRTF-A, was required for cell adhesion. S1P- stimulated proliferation was abolished by knockout of either YAP or MRTF-A. Gene expression analysis by RNA-sequencing of S1P- treated 1321N1 cells in which MRTF-A and or YAP were deleted knockout cells identified 44 genes that were induced through RhoA and highly dependent on YAP, MRTF-A, or both. Knockdown of F3 (tissue factor; TF), a target gene regulated selectively through YAP, when knocked down blocked 1321N1 cell invasion and migration, whereas knockdown of HBEGF (Hheparin binding EGF-like growth factor) (HBEGF), a gene selectively induced through MRTF-A, prevented cell adhesion in response to S1P. Proliferation was sensitive to knockdown of several target genes dually regulated through both YAP and MRTF-A (CCN1 and MYC) or of those regulated by either factor. Expression of these same genes was decreased in tumors from PDX cells lacking YAP or MRTF-A, indicating that these transcriptional pathways are regulated in the in vivo GBM tumor environment and suggesting that their activation through GPCRs and RhoA contributes to growth and maintenance of human GBM.

GSE163906,"PTEN DEFICIENCY LEADS TO PROTEASOME ADDICTION, A NOVEL VULNERABILITY IN GLIOBLASTOMA",33724," We found that GSCs were highly sensitive to proteasome inhibition due to an underlying dependency on an increased protein synthesis rate, and loss of autophagy, associated with PTEN loss and activation of the PI3K/mTOR pathway. In contrast, combinatory inhibition of autophagy and the proteasome, resulted in enhanced cytotoxicity specifically in GSCs that did express PTEN. Finally, proteasome inhibition specifically increased cell death markers in 3D glioblastoma organoids, suppressed tumor growth, and increased survival of mice orthotopically engrafted with GSCs. As perturbations of the PI3K/mTOR pathway occur in nearly 50% of GBMs, these findings suggest that a significant fraction of these tumors could be vulnerable to proteasome inhibition.

GSE163401,CRISPR Screening of CAR T Cells and Cancer Stem Cells Reveals Critical Dependencies for Cell-Based Therapies [GSC],34214," Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most prevalent primary malignant brain tumor, containing self-renewing stem-like GBM stem cells (GSCs) that have been a focus of immunotherapies. Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy has shown evidence of clinical activity, but overall limited responses in patients with GBMs. Here, we interrogated molecular determinants of CAR T cell-mediated GBM killing through whole-genome CRISPR screens in both CAR T cells and patient-derived GSCs. CRISPR screening of CAR T cells identified dependencies for their effector functions, including TLE4 and IKZF2. Targeted knockout of these genes in CAR T cells robustly enhanced antitumor efficacy against GBM patient-derived xenografts (PDXs). Bulk and single cell-RNA sequencing of edited CAR T cells revealed transcriptional profiles of superior effector function and inhibited exhaustion responses. Reciprocal screening of GSCs identified genes essential for their susceptibility to CAR-mediated killing, including RELA and NPLOC4, the knockout of which altered the tumor-immune signaling axis and increased responsiveness of CAR therapy. Overall, CRISPR screening of CAR T cells and GSCs are promising strategies to discover avenues and inform potential combinatorial approaches for enhancing CAR T cell therapeutic efficacy against GBM, and can be extended to reveal key mediators of immunotherapy responses across solid tumors.

GSE117632,N6-methyladenine DNA Modification in Glioblastoma [RNA-seq],34259," Genetic drivers of cancer can be dysregulated through epigenetic modifications of DNA. While the critical role of DNA 5-methylcytosine (5mC) in the regulation of transcription is recognized, the functions of other non-canonical DNA modifications remain obsure. Here, we report the  identification of novel N(6)-methyladenine (N6-mA) DNA modifications in human tissues and implicate this epigenetic regulation in human disease, the highly malignant brain cancer, glioblastoma. Glioblastoma upregulates N6-mA levels, which co-localize with heterochromatic histone modifications, namely H3K9me3. N6-mA levels are dynamically regulated by the DNA demethylase, ALKBH1, to transcriptionally silence oncogenic pathways through decreasing chromatin accessibility. Targeting the N6-mA regulator, ALKBH1, in patient-derived human glioblastoma models inhibited tumor cell proliferation and extended survival of tumor-bearing mice, supporting this novel DNA modification as a potential new molecular therapeutic target for glioblastoma. Collectively, our results uncover a novel epigenetic node in cancer through the DNA modification, N6-mA.

GSE242225,IFI35 regulates non-canonical NF-κB signaling to maintain glioblastoma stem cells and recruit tumor-associated macrophages [RNA-seq],34870," Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most aggressive malignant primary brain tumor characterized by a highly heterogeneous and immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME). The symbiotic interactions between glioblastoma stem cells (GSCs) and tumor-associated macrophages (TAM) in the TME are critical for tumor progression. Here, we identified that IFI35, a transcriptional regulatory factor, plays both cell-intrinsic and cell-extrinsic roles in maintaining GSCs and the immunosuppressive TME. IFI35 induced non-canonical NF-kB signaling through proteasomal processing of p105 to the DNA-binding transcription factor p50, which heterodimerizes with RELB (RELB/p50), and activated cell chemotaxis in a cell autonomous manner. Further, IFI35 induced recruitment and maintenance of M2-like TAMs in TME in a paracrine manner. Targeting IFI35 effectively suppressed in vivo tumor growth and prolonged survival of orthotopic xenograft-bearing mice. Collectively, these findings reveal the tumor-promoting functions of IFI35 and suggest that targeting IFI35 or its downstream effectors may provide effective approaches to improve GBM treatment.

GSE248352,Antitumor effects of intravenous natural killer cell infusion in an orthotopic glioblastoma xenograft murine model and gene expression profile analysis,35223," Despite standard multimodality treatments, including maximal safe resection, te-mozolomide, radiotherapy, and tumor-treating fields, patients with glioblastoma (GBM) face dismal prognosis. Natural killer cell (NKC)-based immunotherapy appears to be a promising approach to treat GBM. We previously reported a novel technique to derive ex vivo-expanded highly activated NKCs from human peripheral blood mononuclear cells, which exhibited no-table antitumor effects against GBM cells. In this study, we performed preclinical evaluation of these NKCs in an in vivo orthotopic xenograft murine model, which was established by sub-cutaneously implanting U87MG cells in nonobese diabetes/severe combined immunodefi-ciency/IL2rγ null (NOG) mice. In this model, administering NKCs via the retro-orbital sinus prolonged the overall survival of NOG mice, indirectly indicating the growth inhibitory ef-fects of NKCs. In addition, we performed a comprehensive analysis of differentially ex-pressed genes using microarray, focusing on the expression of NKC activating receptor lig-ands, NKC inhibitory receptor ligands, chemokines, and chemokine receptors, between intra-cranial tumors treated with NKCs and non-treated intracranial tumors. We also performed differential gene expression analysis between the internal and external layers of intracranial tumors.

GSE251777,An engineered glioblastoma model yields macrophage-secreted drivers of invasion,35337," Glioblastomas (GBMs) are highly invasive brain tumors replete with brain- and blood-derived macrophages, collectively known as tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs). Targeting TAMs has been proposed as a therapeutic strategy but has thus far yielded limited clinical success in slowing GBM progression, due in part to an incomplete understanding of TAM function in GBM. Here, by using an engineered hyaluronic acid-based 3D invasion platform, patient-derived GBM cells, and multi-omics analysis of GBM tumor microenvironments, we show that M2-polarized macrophages stimulate GBM stem cell (GSC) mesenchymal transition and invasion. We identify TAM-derived transforming growth factor beta induced (TGFβI/BIGH3) as a pro-tumorigenic factor in the GBM microenvironment. In GBM patients, BIGH3 mRNA expression correlates with poor patient prognosis and is highest in the most aggressive GBM molecular subtype. Inhibiting TAM-derived BIGH3 signaling with a blocking antibody or small molecule inhibitor suppresses GSC invasion. Our work highlights the utility of 3D in vitro tumor microenvironment platforms to investigate TAM-cancer cell crosstalk and offers new insights into TAM function to guide novel TAM-targeting therapies.

GSE237936,"RNA-sequencing of primary human glioblastoma resected tissue before and after a personalized, neoantigen-based vaccine plus poly-ICLC (NeoVax); tissues from a Phase 1 clinical trial",35364," Glioblastoma (GBM) patient outcomes remain low despite surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy. There are few immunotherapy options due to the lack of tumor immunogenicity. Several clinical trials have reported promising results with cancer vaccines, although most trials have used single tumor region sequencing to identify targetable antigens. This approach limits the antigen pool due to the heterogeneity of GBM tumors. We have implemented multisector sequencing to identify targetable neoantigens across the GBM tumor landscape that were then incorporated into personalized peptide vaccines called NeoVax. Here, we report the findings of four subjects enrolled on the trial. Following NeoVax, we observed a clonal expansion of CD8+ T cells in the peripheral blood that, when expanded in vitro, were reactive to, on average, half of the NeoVax neoantigens tested by IFN-g ELISPOT, including BRAF V600E in one subject. A post-NeoVax tumor biopsy was resected from one subject and also showed evidence of infiltrating CD8+ T cell clonal expansion. Although the patients enrolled in this trial did not achieve remission, this pilot study demonstrates the feasibility of NeoVax and the importance of multisector sampling for neoantigen screening.

GSE244666,Dose dependent transcriptional response to ionizing radiation is orchestrated with DNA repair within the nuclear space [RNA-seq],35431," Radiation therapy is commonly used to treat glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) brain tumor. Ionizing radiation (IR) induces dose- specific variations in transcriptional programs, implicating they are tightly regulated and critical components in the tumor response and survival.  Yet, our understanding of the downstream molecular events triggered by lethal vs sublethal IR doses is limited. Herein, we report that variations in the genetic programs are positively and functionally correlated with the exposure to lethal or sublethal IR doses. Genome architecture analysis revealed that gene regulation is spatially and temporally coordinated with DNA repair kinetics. Radiation-activated genes were pre-positioned in active sub-nuclear compartments and were up-regulated following DNA damage response, while the DNA repair activity shifted to the inactive heterochromatic spatial compartments. The IR dose affected the levels of DNA damage repair and transcription modulation, but not the order of events, which was linked to their spatial nuclear positioning. Thus, distinct coordinated temporal dynamics of DNA damage repair and transcription reprogramming in the active and inactive sub-nuclear compartments highlight the importance of high-order genome organization in synchronizing the molecular events following IR.

GSE241227,Quisinostat is a brain-penetrant radiosensitizer in glioblastoma,35526," In recent years, histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi) have garnered considerable interest for the treatment of adult and pediatric malignant brain tumors. However, owing to their broad-spectrum nature and inability to effectively penetrate the blood-brain barrier, HDACi have failed to provide significant clinical benefit to glioblastoma (GBM) patients to date. Moreover, global inhibition of HDACs results in widespread toxicity, highlighting the need for selective isoform targeting. While no isoform-specific HDACi are currently available, the second-generation hydroxamic acid-based HDACi quisinostat possesses sub-nanomolar specificity for class I HDAC isoforms, particularly HDAC1 and 2. Recently, we demonstrated that HDAC1 is the essential HDAC in GBM. Here, we panalyzed the neuro-pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic and radiation-sensitizing properties of quisinostat in preclinical models of GBM. We found that quisinostat is a well-tolerated and brain-penetrant molecule that significantly extended survival when administered in combination with radiation in vivo. The pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic-efficacy relationship was established by correlating free drug concentrations and evidence of target modulation in the brain with survival benefit. Together, these data provide a strong rationale for clinical development of quisinostat as a radiosensitizer for the treatment of GBM.

Better cell survival, G2M-arrest, senescence/stemness pathways’ induction and YAP activation make this GB cell state more resistant to therapy. Notably, these persister GB cells are highly vessel co-opting, allowing homing to the perivascular niche, which in turn increases their transition to this cell state.

Similar analysis was performed for KRTs and other kidney tumors and normal kidney using data from GEO. Dysregulated genes common to both analyses were analyzed for functional significance. Unsupervised hierarchical clustering of RTs identified 3 major subsets: 2 comprised of AT/RTs, and 1 of KRTs. Compared to other tumors, 1187, 663 and 539 genes were dysregulated in each subset, respectively. Only 14 dysregulated genes were common to all 3 subsets. Compared to normal tissue, 5209, 4275 and 2841 genes were dysregulated in each subset, with an overlap of 610 dysregulated genes. Among these genes, processes associated with cell proliferation, MYC activation, and epigenetic dysregulation were common to all 3 RT subsets. The low overlap of dysregulated genes in AT/RTs and KRTs suggests that factors in addition to SMARCB1 loss play a role in determining subsequent gene expression. Drugs which target cell cycle or epigenetic genes may be useful in all RTs. Additionally, targeted therapies tailored to specific RT subset molecular profiles should be considered.

GSE29796,Transcriptional Differences between Normal and Glioma-Derived Glial Progenitor Cells Identify a Core Set of Dysregulated Genes.,7427,"Glial progenitor cells (GPCs) of the adult human white matter, which express gangliosides recognized by monoclonal antibody A2B5, are a potential source of glial tumors of the brain. We used A2B5-based sorting to extract progenitor-like cells from a range of human glial tumors, that included low-grade glioma, oligodendroglioma, oligo-astrocytomas, anaplastic astrocytoma, and glioblastoma multiforme. The A2B5+ tumor cells proved tumorigenic upon orthotopic xenograft, and the tumors generated reflected the phenotypes of those from which they derived. Expression profiling revealed that A2B5+ tumor progenitors expressed a cohort of genes by which they could be distinguished from A2B5+ GPCs isolated from normal adult white matter. Most of the genes differentially expressed by glioma-derived A2B5+ cells varied as a function of tumor stage; however, a small number were invariably expressed at all stages of gliomagenesis. These glioma progenitor-associated genes included CD24, SIX1 and EYA1, which were up-regulated at all stages of gliomagenesis, and MTUS1 and SPOCK3, which were down-regulated at all stages of tumor progression. qPCR and immunolabeling confirmed the differential expression of these genes in primary gliomas, while pathway analysis permitted their segregation into differentially active signaling pathways. By comparing the expression patterns of glial tumor progenitors to their identically-isolated normal homologues, we have identified a discrete set of oncogenic pathways by which glial tumorigenesis may be both better understood, and more efficiently targeted.

GSE4536,Tumor stem cells more closely mirror the phenotype and genotype of primary human tumors than do cancer cell lines,8076,"The concept of tumor stem cells (TSCs) provides a new paradigm for understanding tumor biology, although it remains unclear whether TSCs will prove to be a more robust model than traditional cancer cell lines. We demonstrate marked phenotypic and genotypic differences between primary human tumor-derived TSCs and their matched glioma cell lines. TSCs derived directly from primary glioblastomas harbor extensive similarities to normal NSC and recapitulate the genotype, gene expression patterns and in vivo biology of human glioblastomas. By contrast, the matched, traditionally grown tumor cell lines do not secondary to in vitro genomic alterations. These findings suggest that TSCs may be a more reliable model than many commonly utilized cancer cell lines for understanding the biology of primary human tumors. Analysis of gene expression data is described in Lee et al., Cancer Cell, 2006.

Here, we identified a predictive signature potentially valuable for indicating vulnerability to MET-targeted therapy in GBM. The use of both human and mouse gene expression microarrays showed that MET inhibitors regulate tumor (human) and host (mouse) cells within the tumor via distinct molecular processes, but overall they impede tumor growth by inhibiting cell cycle progression. Notably, GBM tumors with EGFRamp that showed resistance to erlotinib treatment also showed activation of the MET pathway, suggesting that a combination of EGFR and MET inhibitors may overcome or prevent such resistance in patients with EGFRamp GBM.

GSE82009,caArray_louis-00379: Gene Expression-based Classification of Malignant Gliomas Correlates Better with Survival than Histological Classification,10590,"Microarray analysis was used to determine the expression of 12,000 genes in a set of 50 gliomas, 28 glioblastomas and 22 anaplastic oligodendrogliomas. Supervised learning approaches were used to build a two-class prediction model based on a subset of 14 glioblastomas and 7 anaplastic oligodendrogliomas with classic histology. A 20-feature k-nearest neighbor model correctly classified 18 of the 21 classic cases in leave-one-out cross-validation when compared with pathological diagnoses. This model was then used to predict the classification of clinically common, histologically nonclassic samples. When tumors were classified according to pathology, the survival of patients with nonclassic glioblastoma and nonclassic anaplastic oligodendroglioma was not significantly different (P = 0.19). However, class distinctions according to the model were significantly associated with survival outcome (P = 0.05). This class prediction model was capable of classifying high-grade, nonclassic glial tumors objectively and reproducibly. Moreover, the model provided a more accurate predictor of prognosis in these nonclassic lesions than did pathological classification. These data suggest that class prediction models, based on defined molecular profiles, classify diagnostically challenging malignant gliomas in a manner that better correlates with clinical outcome than does standard pathology.

GSE34152,Expression data from GBM and normal neural CD133+ and CD133- cells,12239,"We use gene expression data to provide a three-faceted analysis on the links between molecular subclasses of glioblastima, epithelial-to mesenchymal transition (EMT) and CD133 cell surface protein. The contribution of this paper is three-folded: First, we used a newly identified signature for epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition in human mammary epithelial cells, and demonstrated that genes in this signature have significant overlap with genes differentially expressed in all known GBM subtypes. However, the overlap between the genes up-regulated in the mesenchymal subtype of GBM and in the EMT signature was more significant than other GBM subtypes. Second, we provided evidence that there is a negative correlation between the genetic signature of EMT and that of CD133 cell surface protein, a putative marker for neural stem cells. Third, we studied the correlation between GBM molecular subtypes and the genetic signature of CD133 cell surface protein. We demonstrated that the mesenchymal and neural subtypes of GBM have the strongest correlations with the CD133 genetic signature. While the mesenchymal subtype of GBM demonstrates similarity with the signatures of both EMT and CD133, it also demonstrates some differences with each of these signatures that is partly due to the fact that the signatures of EMT and CD133 are inversely related to each other. Taken together this data sheds light on role of the mesenchymal transition and neural stem cells, and their mutual interaction, in molecular subtypes of glioblastoma multiforme.

GSE68936,caArray_golub-00299: Chemosensitivity prediction by transcriptional profiling,15820," In an effort to develop a genomics-based approach to the prediction of drug response, we have developed an algorithm for classification of cell line chemosensitivity based on gene expression profiles alone. Using oligonucleotide microarrays, the expression levels of 6,817 genes were measured in a panel of 60 human cancer cell lines (the NCI-60) for which the chemosensitivity profiles of thousands of chemical compounds have been determined. We sought to determine whether the gene expression signatures of untreated cells were sufficient for the prediction of chemosensitivity. Gene expression-based classifiers of sensitivity or resistance for 232 compounds were generated and then evaluated on independent sets of data. The classifiers were designed to be independent of the cells' tissue of origin. The accuracy of chemosensitivity prediction was considerably better than would be expected by chance. Eighty-eight of 232 expression-based classifiers performed accurately (with P &lt; 0.05) on an independent test set, whereas only 12 of the 232 would be expected to do so by chance. These results suggest that at least for a subset of compounds genomic approaches to chemosensitivity prediction are feasible.

GSE135437,Mapping microglia diversity in the human brain through the integration of high-dimensional techniques,15845," Microglia are tissue-resident macrophages of the central nervous system (CNS) that orchestrate local immune responses and contribute to several neurological and psychiatric diseases. Little is known about human microglia and how they orchestrate their highly plastic, context-specific adaptive responses during pathology. Here, we combined two high-dimensional technologies, single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) and time-of-flight mass cytometry (CyTOF), to identify microglia states in the human brain during homeostasis and disease. This approach enabled us to identify and characterize a previously unappreciated spectrum of transcriptional states in human microglia. These transcriptional states are determined by their spatial distribution, and they further change with aging and brain tumor pathology. The description of multiple microglia phenotypes in the human CNS may open promising new avenues for subset-specific therapeutic interventions.

From the remaining fraction of CNS PNETs, we have identified four distinct new CNS tumor entities extending to other neuroepithelial tumors, each associated with a recurrent genetic alteration and particular histopathological and clinical features. These molecular entities, designated “CNS Neuroblastoma with FOXR2 activation (CNS NB FOXR2)”, “CNS Ewing sarcoma family tumor with CIC alteration (CNS EFT CIC)”, “CNS high grade neuroepithelial tumor with MN1 alteration (CNS HGNET MN1)”, and “CNS high grade neuroepithelial tumor with BCOR alteration (CNS HGNET BCOR)”, will enable meaningful clinical trials and the development of therapeutic strategies for patients affected by these poorly differentiated CNS tumors.

GSE184941,Modeling Malignant Progression in Glioma,20333," Gliomas are the most common primary brain tumor in humans. Low-grade gliomas (WHO grade II) invariably progress to high-grade gliomas (WHO grade III or IV). Although malignant progression may take many years, the survival rate after transformation to a high-grade glioma is poor, often only 12-15 months. In this data set, we have identified low-grade gliomas that have progressed to high-grade gliomas or high-grade gliomas that have progressed from low-grade gliomas. Some cases are matched pairs (meaning we have both the original low-grade tumor and the subsequent high-grade tumor). The samples deposited have been analyzed with bulk-RNA sequencing. They are also de-identified but are clinically annotated. When available, genetic information including IDH mutation status, 1p/19q deletion and histological subtype are also included.

GSE181649,Effect of MK-8931 on GSC gene expression,20488," Glioblastoma (GBM), contains different tumor-associated macrophage (TAM) populations that can either promote tumor growth and therapeutic resistance (pTAMs) or have tumor suppressive properties (sTAMs), and thus reprograming pTAMs into sTAMs represents an attractive therapeutic strategy. By screening a collection of small molecule compounds we find that inhibition of the β-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) by MK-8931 potently reprograms pTAMs into sTAMs and promotes macrophage phagocytosis of glioma cells; moreover, low-dose radiation markedly enhances TAM infiltration and synergizes with MK-8931 treatment to suppress malignant growth. BACE1 is preferentially expressed by pTAMs in human GBMs and is required for maintaining pTAM polarization through trans-IL-6-sIL-6R-STAT3 signaling. MK-8931 and other BACE1 inhibitors have been developed for Alzheimer's disease in clinical trials, and have been shown to be safe for humans, these could be potentially streamlined for cancer therapy. Collectively, this study offers a promising therapeutic approach to enhance macrophage-based therapy in GBM.

GSE162783,Identification of Rac guanine nucleotide exchange factors promoting Lgl1 phosphorylation in glioblastoma,20662," The protein Lgl has key roles in the regulation of cell polarity. We have shown that Lgl is inactivated by hyperphosphorylation in glioblastoma as a consequence of PTEN loss and aberrant activation of the PI 3-kinase pathway; this contributes to glioblastoma pathogenesis both by promoting invasion and repressing glioblastoma cell differentiation. Lgl is phosphorylated by atypical protein kinase C in a complex with Par6 and either activated Cdc42 or activated Rac. Here we have investigated the role of specific Rac guanine nucleotide exchange factors in Lgl hyperphosphorylation in glioblastoma. We used CRISPR/Cas9 to knockout PREX1, a PI 3-kinase pathway-responsive Rac guanine nucleotide exchange factor that is overexpressed in glioblastoma. Knockout of PREX1 in patient-derived glioblastoma cells resulted in a reduction in Lgl phosphorylation and this could be reversed by re-expressing PREX1. PREX1 knockout cells showed reduced motility and altered phenotype suggestive of partial neuronal differentiation; consistent with this, RNA-seq analyses of these cells identified sets of PREX1-regulated genes with roles in promoting cell motility and repressing neuronal differentiation. Knockout of PREX1 in glioblastoma cells derived from a second patient did not affect Lgl phosphorylation. These cells overexpressed a short isoform of the Rac guanine nucleotide exchange factor TIAM1; knockdown of TIAM1 in PREX1-knockout cells from this patient reduced Lgl phosphorylation. These data show that PREX1 links aberrant PI 3-kinase to Lgl phosphorylation in glioblastoma, but that TIAM1 can also promote Lgl phosphorylation in a subset of patients. While this shows redundant mechanisms for Lgl phosphorylation, PREX1 appears to have a non-redundant role in glioblastoma cell motility, as this was impaired in PREX1 knockout cells from both patients.

Despite the characteristic heterogeneity of gliomas, we found substantial similarities between the corresponding aspirates and TCRs that included mutations used in the clinical routine and glioma-associated transcriptional signatures. Based on these results, we confirmed the suitability of CUSA-fixed biomaterial from glioma surgeries for downstream applications.

GSE228497,Re-convolving the compositional landscape of primary and recurrent glioblastoma reveals prognostic and targetable tissue states [plateseq],27644," Glioblastoma is an aggressive diffusely infiltrating neoplasm that spreads beyond surgical resection margins, where it intermingles with non-neoplastic brain cells. This complex microenvironment harbouring infiltrating glioma and non-neoplastic brain cells is the origin of tumor recurrence. Thus, understanding the cellular and molecular features of the glioma microenvironment is therapeutically and prognostically important. Here, we used single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNAseq) of primary and recurrent glioma to define three compositional ‘tissue-states’ rooted in cohabitation of cell-types and transcriptional states. These comprise a state featuring A) minimally infiltrated-brain, B) reactive inflamed infiltrated tissue, and C) cellular tumor. Spatial transcriptomics confirmed that the cell-types and transcriptomics states which compositionally cohabitate indeed do colocalize in space. Tissue states are clinically significant because they correlate with radiographic, histopathologic, and prognostic features. We found that in addition to enrichment of tissue state B signature, enrichment of both neoplastic and non-neoplastic cell-type gene signatures in tissue state B correlated with decreased survival. Importantly, we found that our compositionally defined tissue states are enriched in distinct metabolic pathways. One such pathway is fatty acid biosynthesis, which was enriched in tissue state B – a state enriched in recurrent glioblastoma and composed of astrocyte-like/mesenchymal glioma cells, reactive astrocytes resembling those seen in neurodegeneration, and monocyte-like myeloid cells. We discovered that targeting fatty acid synthesis was sufficient to deplete the transcriptional signature of tissue state B. Our findings define a novel compositional approach to the glioma infiltrated tissue which allows us to discover prognostic and targetable features, paving the way to new mechanistic and therapeutic discoveries.

Data analysis and visualization were performed using R software, SPSS software, and Graphpad Prism.Results: By taking the intersection of differentially methylated regions (DMRs) and differentially expressed genes (DEGs), 892 genes were selected for Lasso regression analysis and multivariate Cox analysis, and 12 hub genes were finally screened to construct diagnostic and prognostic models. The diagnostic (AUC=0.982) and prognostic (5-years AUC=0.931) models based on the 12 hub genes had high accuracy.Conclusions: This study reveals that 12 hub genes in CSF ctDNA can diagnose and prognosticate recurrent GBM and provide new biomarkers for clinical research into the mechanisms of GBM recurrent.

GSE239379,The STEMRI trial: magnetic resonance spectroscopy imaging can define tumor areas enriched in glioblastoma-stem-like cells,31684," Despite maximally-safe resection of the MRI-defined contrast-enhanced (CE) central tumor area and chemo-radiotherapy, most glioblastoma patients relapse within one year in peritumor FLAIR regions. Spectroscopic MRI (MRSI) can discriminate metabolic tumor areas with higher recurrence potential as CNI+ regions (Choline/N-acetyl-aspartate Index>2) can predict relapse sites. As relapses are mainly imputed to glioblastoma stem-like cells (GSC), CNI+ areas might be GSC-enriched. We conducted a prospective trial in 16 GBM patients subjected to preoperative MRSI/MRI and surgery/chemo-radiotherapy to investigate GSC content in CNI+ versus CNI- biopsies from CE/FLAIR. Biopsy characterization by RNAseq revealed that FLAIR/CNI+ areas were enriched in stem-related gene signature, but also in pathways related to DNA repair, adhesion/migration and mitochondrial bioenergetics.

GSE159896,Repurposing FDA-approved drugs for the treatment of malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors,31737," Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs) are aggressive soft tissue sarcomas developed from Schwann cell lineage. They account for up to 10% of all soft tissue sarcomas. Although there is an unmet need for new therapeutic agents for MPNSTs, to date there have been few transcriptomic analyses of this tumor type. We studied FDA approved drugs for MPNST treatment and compared their transcriptomic changes in cell lines before and after treatment. We demonstrated that Fludarabine treated NF1 MPNST cells exhibited altered signaling pathways such as the upregulation of the Wnt/Ca+ pathway and downregulation of the hedgehog and hypoxia signaling pathways in the Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) and Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) analysis. The combined Colchicine and Fludarabine treatment enhanced the cytotoxicity of sporadic MPNST cells through altered signaling pathways, including increased Wnt/β-catenin pathway and others. The transcriptomic analysis comparing NF1/sporadic MPNST cells and normal Schwann cells indicated that NF1 MPNST cells had more splicing events, fewer single nucleotide variants, and induced RNA expression than sporadic MPNST cells. In summary, we identified a transcriptomic differences between MPNSTs and Schwann cells, between sporadic MPNST cells and NF1 MPNST cells, and between drug treated MPNST cells and vehicle treated cells.

GSE249282,Glioblastoma Molecular Characteristics and Immune Microenvironment Associated with Survival Outcomes in Patients Treated with Dendritic Cell Vaccination,35551," Purpose:  Autologous tumor lysate-pulsed dendritic cell (DC) vaccination has shown promising long-term survival in a cohort of patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma.  The purpose of this study was to better understand the mechanisms and modulation of the immune microenvironment underlying the clinical efficacy of DC-based vaccine therapy.  Experimental Design:  We performed bulk RNA sequencing on tumor samples from patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma obtained prior to treatment with dendritic cell vaccination.  We characterized the molecular mechanisms and immune microenvironments of long-term survivors (LTS, n= 8), medium-term survivors (MTS, n= 13), and short-term survivors (STS, n = 17). Results:  There was an enrichment of the mesenchymal subtype of glioblastoma in the long-term survival group.  Additionally, decreased tumor cell density, upregulation of cell surface markers, and increased neuronal activity were associated with the longer survival cohorts. Two microglia populations, one associated with increased survival and one associated with decreased survival in the DC-treated cohorts, but not standard of care (SOC) cohorts, are also potentially implicated in response to DC immunotherapy. There were increases in functional activity of the immune environment in longer survivor cohorts. Conclusions:  These analyses suggest the potential to identify tumor-based predictive factors that may be associated with favorable responses to DC vaccination in glioblastoma patients; and if validated, these findings may enable better patient selection for future clinical trials.

GSE256492,"Single-cell atlas of the human brain vasculature across development, adulthood and disease (bulk RNA-Seq)",35829," A broad range of brain pathologies critically relies on the vasculature, and cerebrovascular disease is a leading cause of death worldwide. However, the cellular and molecular architecture of the human brain vasculature remains incompletely understood. Here, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing of 606,380 freshly isolated endothelial, perivascular and other tissue-derived cells from 117 samples, from 68 human fetuses and adult patients to construct a molecular atlas of the developing fetal, adult control and diseased human brain vasculature. We uncover extensive molecular heterogeneity of the vasculature of healthy fetal and adult human brains and across eight vascular-dependent Central Nervous System (CNS) pathologies including brain tumors and brain vascular malformations. We identify alteration of arteriovenous differentiation and reactivated fetal as well as conserved dysregulated genes and pathways in the diseased vasculature. Pathological endothelial cells display a loss of CNS-specific properties and reveal an upregulation of MHC class II molecules, indicating atypical features of CNS endothelial cells. Cell-cell interaction analyses predict numerous endothelial-to-perivascular cell ligand-receptor crosstalk including immune-related and angiogenic pathways, thereby unraveling a central role for the endothelium within brain neurovascular unit signaling networks. Our single-cell brain atlas provides insight into the molecular architecture and heterogeneity of the developing, adult/control and diseased human brain vasculature and serves as a powerful reference for future studies

GSE199407,Dissecting the tumour microenvironment displays different genomic profile in patients treated with carmustine wafers.,25825," Despite the state-of-the art treatment, consisting of surgery followed by chemo and radiotherapy, patients diagnosed for a glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), have a median overall survival of 14 months. The lack of therapeutic efficacy is due to the great inter- and intra-tumour cellular and molecular heterogeneity, the biological aggressiveness, the ability to develop drug resistance as well as the infiltrative nature of tumour cells into the surrounding brain parenchyma. Furthermore, it has been widely shown that GBM progression is supported not only by tumour cells, but also by their interaction with the surrounding microenvironment. In the late 90s, a novel adjuvant therapy has been approved involving the placement, in the resection cavity, of wafers delivering carmustine (CW). Although reported studies are contrasting a retrospective study, performed in our Institute, revealed that the treatment of 116 GBM patients by CW showed 17% of long-term survivors (OS >36 months). We isolated glioma-associated stem cells (GASC), resident in the glioma microenvironment, from tumour samples of 3 patients responsive and 3 patients not responsive to CW implantation and we performed a transcriptomic analysis to identify differentially expressed genes. We found that GASC derived from the two classes of patients have distinctive transcriptomic profiles and we selected 78 differentially expressed genes to explore and validate their expression in more GASC cell lines. We identified four genes specifically downregulated in GASC isolated from patients with longer OS (>30 months). These genes showed a correlation with clinical data deposited in TCGA-GBM dataset.

GSE236494,Clariom D Pico gene array of microdissected GBM areas or PBMCs.,31964," Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) presents a formidable clinical challenge due to its complex microenvironment. Here, we introduce lipid droplet (LD)-loaded macrophages, or tumor-associated foam cells (TAFs), as a previously unidentified immune cell population in GBM. Through extensive analyses of patient tumors, together with in vitro and in vivo investigations, we reveal that TAFs exhibit distinct pro-tumorigenic characteristics related to hypoxia, mesenchymal transition, angiogenesis, and impaired phagocytosis. Moreover, TAF presence correlates with worse patient outcome. Our mechanistic investigations demonstrate that TAF formation is facilitated by lipid cargo from extracellular vesicles released by GBM cells. Importantly, we demonstrate that targeting key enzymes involved in LD formation, such as DGAT1 or ACSL, effectively disrupts TAF functionality. This study establishes TAFs as a prominent immune cell entity in GBM and provides valuable insights into their interplay within the microenvironment. Disrupting LD formation to target TAFs presents an interesting avenue for future therapeutic development in GBM.

GSE51305,Gene expression profiles of Sunitinib-treated but not untreated short-term serum-free cultures predict treatment response of human high-grade gliomas in vitro,34494," High-grade gliomas are amongst the most deadly human tumors. Treatment results are overall disappointing. Nevertheless, in several trials around 20% of patients respond to therapy. Diagnostic strategies to identify those patients that will ultimately profit from a specific targeted therapy are urgently needed. Gene expression profiling of untreated tumors is a well established approach for identifying biomarkers or diagnostic signatures. However, reliable signatures predicting treatment response in gliomas do not exist. Here we suggest a novel strategy for developing diagnostic signatures. We postulate that predictive gene expression patterns emerge only after tumor cells have been treated with the agent in vitro. Moreover, we postulate that enriching specimens for tumor initiating cells sharpens predictive expression patterns. Here, we report on the prediction of treatment response of cancer cells in vitro. As a proof of principle we analyzed gene expression in 18 short-term serum-free cultures of high-grade gliomas enhanced for brain tumor initiating cells (BTIC) before and after in vitro treatment with the tyrosine kinase inhibitor Sunitinib. Profiles from treated but not from untreated glioma cells allowed to predict therapy-induced impairment of proliferation of glioma cells in vitro. Prediction can be achieved with as little as 6 genes allowing for a straightforward translation into the clinic once the predictive power of the signature is shown also in vivo. Our strategy of using expression profiles from in vitro treated BTIC-enriched cultures opens new ways for trial design for patients with malignant gliomas.

GSE76990,Validation study: Response-predictive gene expression profiling of glioma progenitor cells in vitro,10921,"Background. In a previous publication we introduced a novel approach to identify genes that hold predictive information about treatment outcome. A linear regression model was fitted by using the least angle regression algorithm (LARS) with the expression profiles of a construction set of 18 glioma progenitor cells enhanced for brain tumor initiating cells (BTIC) before and after in vitro treatment with the tyrosine kinase inhibitor Sunitinib. Profiles from treated progenitor cells allowed predicting therapy-induced impairment of proliferation in vitro. Prediction performance was validated in leave one out cross validation. Methods. In this study, we used an additional validation set of 18 serum-free short-term treated in vitro cell cultures to test the predictive properties of the signature in an independent cohort. We assessed proliferation rates together with transcriptome-wide expression profiles after Sunitinib treatment of each individual cell culture, following the methods of the previous publication. Results. We confirmed treatment-induced expression changes in our validation set, but our signature failed to predict proliferation inhibition. Conclusion. Although the gene signature published from our construction set exhibited good prediction accuracy in cross validation, we were not able to validate the signature in an independent validation data set. Reasons could be regression to the mean, the moderate numbers of samples, or too low differences in the response to proliferation inhibition. At this stage and based on the presented results, we conclude that the signature does not warrant further developmental steps towards clinical application.

While no expression signature was found that could discriminate clinically-aggressive or recurrent tumors from more indolent cases, PAs arising in patients with NF1 did exhibit a unique gene expression pattern. In addition, we identified a gene expression signature that stratified PAs by location (supratentorial versus infratentorial).

GSE73066,Transcriptional profiles of pilocytic astrocytoma,9376,"Pilocytic astrocytoma is the most common type of brain tumor in pediatric population, generally connected with favorable prognosis, although recurrences or dissemination sometimes are also observed. For tumors originating in supra- or infratentorial location different molecular background was suggested but plausible correlations between transcriptional profile and radiological features and/or clinical course are still undefined. The purpose of this study was to identify gene expression profiles related to the most frequent locations of this tumor, subtypes based on various radiological features and clinical pattern of the disease.   According to the radiological features presented on MRI, all cases were divided into four subtypes: solid or mainly solid, cystic with an enhancing cyst wall, cystic with a non-enhancing cyst wall and solid with central necrosis. Bioinformatic analyses showed that gene expression profile of pilocytic astrocytoma highly depends on the tumor location. Most prominent differences were noted for IRX2, PAX3, CXCL14, LHX2, SIX6, CNTN1 and SIX1 genes expression which could distinguish pilocytic astrocytomas of different location even within supratentorial region. Analysis of the genes potentially associated between radiological features showed much weaker transcriptome differences. Single genes showed association with the tendency to progression.   Here we showed that pilocytic astrocytomas of three different locations could be precisely differentiated on the basis of gene expression level but their transcriptional profiles did not strongly reflect the radiological appearance of the tumor or the course of the disease.

These 21 JPAs were further clustered into two major groups by unsupervised hierarchical clustering using a set of 848 genes with high covariance (0.5-10). Supervised analysis with Significance Analysis of Microarrays software between these two potential subgroups identified a list of significant differentially expressed genes involved in cell adhesion, regulation of cell growth, cell motility, nerve ensheathment, and angiogenesis.

To further define their molecular development, we analysed the global DNA methylation profiles of 61 PAs and 6 normal cerebellum samples and integrated this data with transcriptome profiling. These data revealed two subgroups of PA that separate according to tumor location (infratentorial versus supratentorial), and identified key neural developmental genes that are differentially methylated between the two groups. Significant expression differences were identified for the majority of differentially methylated genes, and these were unexpectedly associated with a strong positive correlation between methylation and expression. We also identified a large number of differentially methylated/expressed genes between cerebellar PAs and normal cerebellum, which included additional developmental genes.

GSE199361,The clinical and molecular characteristics of progressive hypothalamic/optic pathway pilocytic astrocytoma [RNA-Seq],26938," Unresectable hypothalamic/optic pathway pilocytic astrocytoma (PA) can be challenging to manage due to repeated progressions despite multiple lines of therapy. To identify clinical and biologic factors associated with tumor progression, we retrospectively identified 72 unresectable, non-NF1-associated, hypothalamic/optic pathway PA. Tumors were classified as low- (6.9%), intermediate- (43.1%), and high-risk (50%) based on their response to treatment. High-risk tumors were defined as those that progressed after three or more lines of chemotherapy/targeted therapy, progressed after radiation, developed metastatic disease, or died of disease. DNA methylation profiling and transcriptome analysis (RNA sequencing) were performed on treatment-naïve tumors with available tissue, and the findings were validated by immunohistochemistry (IHC) on additional tumor tissue. The median follow-up of the entire cohort was 12.3 years. High-risk tumors were associated with male sex (M:F = 2.6:1), younger age at diagnosis (median 3.2 years vs. 6.7 years, P = 0.005), and high incidence of KIAA1549-BRAF fusion (81.5% vs. 38.5%, P = 0.0032). High-risk tumors demonstrated decreased CpG methylation and increased RNA expression in many mitochondrial genes and genes downstream of E2F and NKX2.3 transcription factors. Transcriptome analysis identified transcription factor TBX3 and proto-oncogene serine/threonine protein kinase PIM1 as common downstream targets of both E2F and NKX2.3 and potential drivers of tumor progression. IHC confirmed increased expression of TBX3 and PIM1 in high-risk tumors. PIM1 is known to increase the stability and transcriptional activity of MYC, and gene enrichment analysis identified enrichment of MYC targets. Signaling pathways known to be implicated in pilocytic astrocytoma, such as MAPK and PI3K/AKT/mTOR, were also enriched, as well as pathways related to mitochondrial biogenesis and oxidative phosphorylation. Our results support the model in which the p53-PIM1-MYC axis and TBX3 act alongside MAPK and PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathways to promote tumor progression in hypothalamic/optic pathway PA, highlighting potential new targets for combination therapy and refining disease prognosis.

To identify novel gene dependencies in adult and pediatric brain tumor isolates, we integrated data from functional genomic lethality screens in primary brain tumor isolates with machine learning network models from lethality screens performed in >900 cancer cell lines.  Integrated network models revealed molecular and phenotypic features that predict candidate genetic dependencies in multiple brain tumor types, including: atypical teratoid rhabdoid tumors, diffuse intrinsic pontine gliomas, ependymomas, medulloblastomas, and glioblastomas (primary and recurrent).  Some examples of dependencies and predictors include: ADAR and MX1 protein expression; EFR3A and low EFR3B expression; FBXO42 and spindle assembly checkpoint activation; FGFR1 and high FGF2 expression; and SMARCC2 in SMARCB1 mutated ATRT tumors. In general, the results demonstrate that large functional genetic data sets can be leveraged to identify, validate, and categorize gene dependencies and their associated biomarkers in primary tumor isolates. The results also highlight some of the challenges and limitations of this approach.

GSE202200,Aberrant L-Fucose accumulation and increased core fucosylation are specific metabolic liabilities in mesenchymal glioblastoma,27133," Dysregulated metabolism in glioblastoma (GBM), the deadliest brain tumor of adults, offers an opportunity to deploy metabolic interventions as precise therapeutic strategies. To identify the molecular drivers and the modalities by which different molecular subgroups of GBM exploit metabolic rewiring to sustain tumor progression, we interrogated the transcriptome, the metabolome and the glycoproteome of human subgroup-specific GBM stem cells (GSCs). Here we report that L-Fucose abundance and core fucosylation activation are more highly enhanced in mesenchymal (MES) than in proneural (PN) GSCs; this pattern is retained in subgroup-specific xenografts and, most significantly, retrieved in subgroup-affiliated human patients’ samples. Genetic and pharmacological inhibition of core fucosylation in MES GBM preclinical models results in significant reduction in tumor burden. LC/MS-based glycoproteomic screening indicates that most MES-restricted core fucosylated proteins are involved in therapeutically relevant GBM pathological processes, such as extracellular matrix interaction, cell adhesion and integrin-mediated signaling. Notably, selective L-Fucose accumulation in MES GBMs is demonstrated by pre-clinical minimally-invasive positron emission tomography (PET), implying this metabolite as a potential subgroup-restricted biomarker. Overall, these findings indicate that L-Fucose pathway activation in MES GBM offers subgroup-specific, GSC-restricted dependencies to be exploited as diagnostic markers and actionable therapeutic targets.

We observed that although the Notch1 receptor was activated, the typical target proteins (HES5, HEY1, HEY2) were not or barely expressed in two explored GBM stem cell cultures. Notch1 signalling activation by expression of the intracellular form (NICD) in these cells was found to reduce their growth rate and migration which was accompanied by the sharp reduction of neural stem cell transcription factor expression (ASCL1, OLIG2, SOX2) while HEY1/2, KLF9, SNAI2 transcription factors were upregulated. Expression of OLIG2 and growth were restored after termination of Notch1 stimulation.  Remarkably, NICD expression induced the expression of pericyte cell markers (NG2, PDGFRb and a-smooth muscle actin (aSMA)) in GBM stem cells. This was paralleled with the induction of several angiogenesis-related factors most notably cytokines (HB-EGF, IL8, PLGF), metalloprotease (MMP9) and adhesion proteins (VCAM-1, ICAM-1, ITGA9). In xenotransplantation experiments, contrasting with the infiltrative and poorly-vascularized tumors obtained with control GBM stem cells, Notch1 stimulation resulted in poorly-disseminating but highly-vascularized grafts containing large vessels with lumen. Notch1-stimulated GBM cells expressed pericyte cell markers and closely associated with endothelial cells. These results reveal an important role for the Notch1 pathway in regulating GBM stem cell plasticity and angiogenic properties.

GSE214801,Cancer-selective metabolic vulnerabilities in MYC-amplified medulloblastoma [RNA-seq],27128," MYC-driven medulloblastoma (MB) is an aggressive pediatric brain tumor characterized by therapy resistance and disease recurrence. Here we integrated data from unbiased genetic screening and metabolomic profiling to identify multiple cancer-selective metabolic vulnerabilities in MYC-driven MB tumor cells, which are amenable to therapeutic targeting. Among these targets, dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH), an enzyme that catalyzes de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis, emerged as a favorable candidate for therapeutic targeting. Mechanistically, DHODH inhibition acts on-target leading to uridine metabolite scarcity and hyperlipidemia, accompanied by reduced protein O-GlcNAcylation and c-Myc degradation. Pyrimidine starvation evokes a metabolic stress response that leads to cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. We further show that an orally available small molecule DHODH inhibitor demonstrates potent mono-therapeutic efficacy against patient-derived MB xenografts in vivo. The reprogramming of pyrimidine metabolism in MYC-driven medulloblastoma represents an unappreciated therapeutic strategy and a potential new class of treatments with stronger cancer selectivity and fewer neurotoxic sequelae.

GSE122679,Receptor tyrosine kinase signaling promotes post-embryonic morphogenesis and survival of glia and neural progenitor cells,15695," Glioblastomas (GBMs), which are the most deadly malignant brain tumors of children and adults, infiltrate the brain and grow rapidly, and are resistant to current therapies. Glioblastomas (GBMs) frequently display mutations that activate receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), such as EGFR, which are thought to cooperate with additional factors to drive tumorigenesis. To identify and characterize genetic pathways that cooperate with RTKs to drive GBM progression, we performed RNA sequencing on several cell cultures created from surgical specimens from tumors with alterations in RTKs, and these cultures were grown as neurospheres in serum-free media used for normal neural stem/progenitor cell cultures. Under these conditions, GBM cells retain many defining features and mutations found in primary tumors. For comparison, we profiled commercially available human normal neural stem cells (HNPCs), which were grown under the same conditions. Data from these cell cultures was analyzed for transcripts differentially expressed between GBM cells and HNPCs, which showed that GBM cells that show RTK alterations strongly overexpressed the PDGFA and IGF2 secreted factors, which likely cooperate with EGFR to drive tumor progression.

GSE58923,Aberrant differentiation of glioma stem cells: Implications for therapeutic targeting [Xenograph],9363,"SUMMARY  Terminal differentiation has been proposed as a therapeutic strategy for glioblastoma (GBM). Culturing of GBM derived tumor initiating glioma stem cells (GSCs) in fetal bovine serum containing media is a proposed mode of differentiation that is thought to induce loss of stem cell characteristics, promote neural lineage differentiation and a parallel loss of tumor initiation capacity. Here we show that GSCs retained both neurosphere formation and tumor initiation abilities after short or long term serum exposure. Under serum induced differentiating conditions, GSCs expressed both neural lineage and stem cell markers, highlighting the aberrant pseudo-differentiation state. GSCs maintained under adherent differentiating conditions continued to proliferate and initiate tumor formation with efficiencies similar to GSCs maintained under proliferating (neurosphere) conditions. Proneural (PN) GSCs under serum exposure showed an induction of mesenchymal (MES) gene expression signatures. Our data indicate that the tumor initiation ability of GSCs is independent of their differentiation state and that terminal differentiation as a therapeutic approach may not effectively negate tumorigenicity of GSCs.

GSE245762,Proteotranscriptomic decoding of the surface-endocytome in primary glioblastoma cells identifies potential target antigens in the hypoxic tumor niche,31709," Backgroung: Antibody and cell-based immunotherapies, e.g., antibody-drug-conjugates and CAR-T cells, targeted at cell-surface proteins, currently revolutionize clinical oncology. However, target selection warrants a better understanding of the surface-endocytome and how it is modulated by the tumor microenvironment. Here, we unravel the surface-endocytome landscape and its remodeling by hypoxia in primary cultures from glioblastoma (GBM) patients that currently lack targeted therapies. Methods. We employed a comprehensive approach for global and dynamic mapping of surfaceome and endocytosed (endocytome) proteins in primary GBM cultures at normoxia or hypoxia. Selected target candidates were validated by immunofluorescence analyses in patient tumor sections, spheroids, and 2D cultures, and were finally confronted by ADC cytotoxicity studies. Results: We reveal a heterogeneous surface-endocytome profile across GBM cultures from three patients representing different transcriptional subtypes. CD44 emerged as a commonly abundant surfaceome antigen across GBM cultures, and we established a direct correlation between CD44 endocytic activity and ADC cytotoxicity. We elucidate how hypoxia profoundly reshapes the global surface-endocytome, and identify several hypoxia-induced antigens (CXADR, CD47, BSG, CD81, FXYD6), unique to or shared among GBM cultures. Importantly, we highlight the limited correlation between transcriptomics and proteomics, emphasizing the critical role of membrane protein enrichment strategies and targeted mass spectometry. Conclusions: These studies provide a comperehensive map of the surface-endocytome and its remodeling by hypoxia in GBM as a resource for target discovery. As proof-of-concept, we validate several proteins, either abundantly expressed in normoxia or induced by hypoxia, for further exploration as potential targets of immunotherapeutic approaches in GBM.

GSE70231,caArray_hanas-00078: Distinctive molecular profiles of high-grade and low-grade gliomas based on oligonucleotide microarray analysis,15493," Astrocytomas are heterogeneous intracranial glial neoplasms ranging from the highly aggressive malignant glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) to the indolent, low-grade pilocytic astrocytoma. We have investigated whether DNA microarrays can identify gene expression differences between high-grade and low-grade glial tumors. We compared the transcriptional profile of 45 astrocytic tumors including 21 GBMs and 19 pilocytic astrocytomas using oligonucleotide-based microarrays. Of the approximately 6800 genes that were analyzed, a set of 360 genes provided a molecular signature that distinguished between GBMs and pilocytic astrocytomas. Many transcripts that were increased in GBM were not previously associated with gliomas and were found to encode proteins with properties that suggest their involvement in cell proliferation or cell migration. Microarray-based data for a subset of genes was validated using real-time quantitative reverse transcription-PCR. Immunohistochemical analysis also localized the protein products of specific genes of interest to the neoplastic cells of high-grade astrocytomas. Our study has identified a large number of novel genes with distinct expression patterns in high-grade and low-grade gliomas.

There are three other proteins of this family present in humans of which Regnase-1/MCPIP1/ZC3H12A is the founder member as well as the best-described protein.  All proteins of this family contain a NYN domain with endoribonuclease activity and a CCCH-type zinc finger responsible for interaction with substrate RNA. Although the NYN domain has a high degree of similarity across all four members the in vitro RNase activity was shown only for two of them, namely Regnase-1 and Regnase-3. Interestingly the ZC3H12 family proteins have unique expression patterns with Regnase-2 being expressed almost solely in the central nervous system. What is more, Regnase-2 is downregulated in human glioblastoma, and its expression is inversely correlated with tumor grade. To decipher the role of Regnase-2 in human glioblastoma we performed RNA sequencing of U-251 MG cells overexpressing Regnase-2 and control, mock-transfected cells.

GSE72468,EGFR Mutation Promotes Glioblastoma Through Epigenome and Transcription Factor Network Remodeling,33681," Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) gene amplification and mutations are the most common oncogenic events in Glioblastoma (GBM), but the mechanisms by which they promote aggressive tumor growth are not well understood. Here, through integrated epigenome and transcriptome analyses of cell lines, genotyped clinical samples and TCGA data, we show that EGFR mutations remodel the activated enhancer landscape of GBM, promoting tumorigenesis through a SOX9 and FOXG1-dependent transcriptional regulatory network in vitro and in vivo. The most common EGFR mutation, EGFRvIII, sensitizes GBM cells to the BET-bromodomain inhibitor JQ1 in a SOX9, FOXG1-dependent manner. These results identify the role of transcriptional/epigenetic remodeling in EGFR-dependent pathogenesis and suggest a mechanistic basis for epigenetic therapy.

GSE206357,Regulatory networks driving expression of genes critical for glioblastoma are controlled by the transcription factor c-Jun and the pre-existing epigenetic modifications,28184," Glioblastoma (GBM, WHO grade IV) is an aggressive, primary brain tumor. Despite gross surgery and forceful radio- and chemotherapy, survival of GBM patients did not improve over decades. Several studies reported transcription deregulation in GBMs but regulatory mechanisms driving overexpression of GBM-specific genes remain largely unknown. Transcription in open chromatin regions is directed by transcription factors (TFs) that bind to specific motifs, recruit co-activators/repressors and a transcriptional machinery. Identification of GBM-related TFs-gene regulatory networks may reveal new, targetable mechanisms of gliomagenesis.

GSE45899,Expression profiling of glioblastoma cancer stem cells,6447,"Glioblastoma (GBM) is thought to be driven by a sub-population of cancer stem cells (CSCs) that self-renew and recapitulate tumor heterogeneity, yet remain poorly understood. Here we present a comparative epigenomic analysis of GBM CSCs that reveals widespread activation of genes normally held in check by Polycomb repressors. These activated targets include a large set of developmental transcription factors (TFs) whose coordinated activation is unique to the CSCs. We demonstrate that a critical factor in the set, ASCL1, activates Wnt signaling by repressing the negative regulator DKK1. We show that ASCL1 is essential for maintenance and in vivo tumorigenicity of GBM CSCs. Genomewide binding profiles for ASCL1 and the Wnt effector LEF1 provide mechanistic insight and suggest widespread interactions between the TF module and the signaling pathway. Our findings demonstrate regulatory connections between ASCL1, Wnt signaling and collaborating TFs that are essential for the maintenance and tumorigenicity of GBM CSCs.

GSE199185,Lichen secondary metabolites inhibit Wnt/β-catenin pathway in glioblastoma cells and improve the anticancer effects of temozolomide,25174," Lichens are a source of secondary metabolites with significant pharmacological potential. Data regarding their possible application in glioblastoma (GBM) treatment are, however scarce. The study aimed to analyze the mechanism of action of six lichen secondary metabolites: atranorin, caperatic acid, physodic acid, squamatic acid, salazinic acid, and lecanoric acid using two- and three-dimensional GBM cell line models. The Parallel Artificial Membrane Permeation Assay was used to predict the blood-brain barrier penetration ability of the tested compounds. Their cytotoxicity was analyzed using MTT test on A-172, T98G, and U-138 MG cells. Flow cytometry was applied for the analysis of oxidative stress, cell cycle distribution, and apoptosis, whereas qPCR and microarrays detected the induced transcriptomic changes. Our data confirm the ability of lichen secondary metabolites to cross the blood-brain barrier and exert cytotoxicity against GBM cells. Moreover, the compounds generated oxidative stress, interfered with the cell cycle, and induced apoptosis in T98G cells. They also inhibited Wnt/β-catenin pathway, and this effect was even stronger in case of a co-treatment with temozolomide. Transcriptomic changes in cancer related genes induced by caperatic acid and temozolomide were the most pronounced. Lichen secondary metabolites, in particular caperatic acid should be further analyzed as potential anti-GBM agents.

GSE78703,Pharmacological Targeting of a Metabolic Co-Dependency Pathway in Brain Cancers,18930," Mutations in growth factor receptor signaling pathways are common in cancer, including in tumors that arise from or metastasize to the brain. However, most small-molecule inhibitors targeting growth factor receptors have failed to show efficacy for brain cancers, potentially due to inability to achieve sufficient drug levels in the CNS. Targeting non-oncogene tumor co-dependencies provides an alternative approach, particularly if drugs with high brain penetration can be identified. Here we demonstrate that EGFR-mutant cancers, including a highly lethal form of brain cancer glioblastoma (GBM), are remarkably dependent on cholesterol for survival, rendering them sensitive to Liver X receptor (LXR) agonist-dependent cell death. We show that LXR-623, a clinically viable, highly brain-penetrant LXR?-partial/LXR?-full agonist selectively kills GBM cells in an LXR?- and cholesterol-dependent fashion, causing massive tumor regression and prolonged survival in mouse models. Thus, a metabolic co-dependency provides a pharmacological means to kill growth factor-activated cancers in the CNS.

GSE133479,Cancer avatars derived from genetically engineered pluripotent stem cells allow for longitudinal assessment of tumor development,25207," Many current cellular models aimed to elucidate cancer biology do not recapitulate pathobiology including tumor heterogeneity, an inherent feature of cancer that underlies treatment resistance.  Here we introduce a new cancer modeling paradigm using genetically engineered human pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) that capture authentic cancer pathobiology.  Orthotopic engraftment of the neural progenitor cells derived from hiPSCs introduced with tumor-associated genetic driver mutations revealed by The Cancer Genome Atlas project for glioblastoma (GBM) results in formation of brain tumors.  As observed in GBM patient samples, these models harbor inter-tumor heterogeneity resembling different GBM molecular subtypes, and intra-tumor heterogeneity.  Further, re-engraftment of these tumor cells generate tumors with features characteristic of patient samples and present mutation-dependent patterns of tumor evolution.  Thus, these cancer avatar models provide a platform for a comprehensive longitudinal assessment of human tumor development as governed by molecular subtype mutations.

Many studies have indicated that IDO1 is a critical suppressive immune checkpoint molecule invovled in various types of cancer. Canonically, the underlying mechanism of IDO1 immunosuppressive role is related with its enzyme activity, that is the depletion of Trp and accumulation of Kyn lead to increased tumor infiltrating suppressive regulatory T cells. Recent studies, however, challenged this hypothesis and imply that tumor cell-derived IDO1 can mediate immunosuppression independent of its enzyme activity. In this study, we aim to identify genes that are regulated by IDO1 in human glioblastoma cells, a gene expression regulatory function of IDO1 that is indepent of its enzyme activity.

GSE45161,Expression data from in vivo experiment comparing untreated controls with animals treated with bevacizumab (Avastin),16112," Bevacizumab induces glioblastoma resistance in two in vivo xenograft models. Two cell lines were developed with acquired resistance to bevacizumab. Gene expression difference were analyzed between treated and untreated tumors.  Purpose: Antiangiogenic therapy reduces vascular permeability and delays progression but may ultimately promote an aggressive treatment-resistant phenotype. The aim of the present study was to identify mechanisms responsible for glioblastoma resistance to antiangiogenic therapy.  Experimental Design: Glioma stem cell (GSC) NSC11 and U87 cell lines with acquired resistance to bevacizumab were developed from orthotopic xenografts in nude mice treated with bevacizumab. Genome-wide analyses were used to identify changes in tumor subtype and specific factors associated with resistance.  Results: Mice with established parental NSC11 and U87 cells responded to bevacizumab, whereas glioma cell lines derived at the time of acquired resistance to anti-VEGF therapy were resistant to bevacizumab and did not have prolongation of survival compared to untreated controls. Gene expression profiling comparing anti-VEGF therapy-resistant cell lines to untreated controls demonstrated an increase in genes associated with a mesenchymal origin, cellular migration/invasion, and inflammation. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) demonstrated that bevacizumab-treated tumors showed a highly significant correlation to published mesenchymal gene signatures. Mice bearing resistant tumors showed significantly greater infiltration of myeloid cells in NSC11 and U87 resistant tumors. Invasion-related genes were also upregulated in both NSC11 and U87 resistant cells, which had higher invasion rates in vitro compared with their respective parental cell lines.  Conclusions: Our studies identify multiple pro-inflammatory factors associated with resistance and identify a proneural-to-mesenchymal transition (PMT) in tumors resistant to antiangiogenic therapy.

GSE75665,IL-10 dysregulation in acute mountain sickness revealed by transcriptome analysis,18840," Acute mountain sickness (AMS), which may progress to life-threatening high altitude cerebral edema, is a major threat to millions of people who live in or travel to high altitude. Although studies have revealed the risk factors and pathophysiology theories of AMS, the molecular mechanisms of it do not comprehensively illustrate. Here, we used a system-level methodology, RNA sequencing, to explore the molecular mechanisms of AMS at genome-wide level in 10 individuals. After exposure to high altitude, a total of 1,164 and 1,322 differentially expressed transcripts were identified in AMS and non-AMS groups, respectively. Among them, only 328 common transcripts presented between the two groups. Immune and inflammatory responses were overrepresented in participants with AMS, but not in non-AMS individuals. Anti-inflammatory cytokine IL10 and inflammation cytokines IF17F and CCL8 exhibited significantly different genetic connectivity in AMS compared to that of non-AMS individuals based on network analysis. IL10 was down-regulated and both IF17F and CCL8 were un-regulated in AMS individuals. Moreover, the serum concentration of IL10 significantly decreased in AMS patients after exposure to high altitude (p = 0.001) in another population (n=22). There was a large negative correlation between the changes of IL10 concentration, r(22) = -0.52, p =  0.013,  and Lake Louise Score. Taken together, our analysis provides unprecedented characterization of AMS transcriptome and identifies that genes involved in immune and inflammatory responses were disturbed in AMS individuals by high altitude exposure. The reduction of IL10 after exposure to high altitude was associated with AMS.

GSE254461,"Machine-learning model based on glycosyltransferase expression predicts multiple cancer types, subtypes and survival probability",35336," Whereas current tools for diagnosing cancer focus on identifying markers in limited types of the disease, such as the PAM50 kit known primarily for subtyping breast cancer, our research reveals that 27 different cancers have a unique glycosyltransferase (GT) fingerprint that can be detected using a single test, with 93.7% accuracy in external validation. Four models were built on the expression patterns of 71 GTs that are universally influential in inducing the formation of cancer cells and giving them the impetus to metastasize. The first differentiates cancer tissue from normal tissue, the second distinguishes cancer types, and the third and fourth models differentiate between subtypes of cancer, in particular breast cancer and glioma. Data from the Cancer Genome Atlas database were used for deriving the models, while independent publicly available databases and newly collected patient samples were used for validation. Running these models against external databases showed just how powerful they are, producing results that were highly comparable to those achieved in internal testing. Furthermore, the breast cancer classifier differentiated between breast cancer subtypes with an average of 81% accuracy in external testing, far surpassing the industry-standard PAM50’s accuracy ratio of 43%. Meanwhile, a separate prognostic model designed to predict the probability of survival among glioma patients achieved high accuracy by zooming in on four GT genes that are strongly related to prognosis. Taken together, the models demonstrate the revolutionary potential of focusing on GT genes to simplify cancer diagnostics.

GSE171163,Elevated Asparagine Biosynthesis Drives Brain Tumor Stem Cell Metabolic Plasticity and Resistance to Oxidative Stress,20517," Asparagine synthetase (ASNS) is a gene on the long arm of chromosome 7 that is copy number amplified in the majority of glioblastomas. ASNS copy number amplification is associated with a significantly decreased survival. Using patient-derived glioma stem cells (GSCs), we showed significant metabolic alterations occur in gliomas when perturbing the expression of asparagine synthetase, which is not merely restricted to amino acid homeostasis. ASNS-high GSCs maintained a slower basal metabolic profile yet readily shifted to a greatly increased capacity for glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation when needed. This led ASNS-high cells to a greater ability to proliferate and spread into brain tissue. Finally, we demonstrate that these changes confer resistance to cellular stress, notably oxidative stress, through adaptive redox homeostasis which led to radiation resistance. Furthermore, ASNS overexpression led to modifications of the one-carbon metabolism to promote a more antioxidant tumor environment revealing a metabolic vulnerability that may be therapeutically exploited.

To identify novel gene dependencies in adult and pediatric brain tumor isolates, we integrated data from functional genomic lethality screens in primary brain tumor isolates with machine learning network models from lethality screens performed in >900 cancer cell lines.  Integrated network models revealed molecular and phenotypic features that predict candidate genetic dependencies in multiple brain tumor types, including: atypical teratoid rhabdoid tumors, diffuse intrinsic pontine gliomas, ependymomas, medulloblastomas, and glioblastomas (primary and recurrent).  Some examples of dependencies and predictors include: ADAR and MX1 protein expression; EFR3A and low EFR3B expression; FBXO42 and spindle assembly checkpoint activation; FGFR1 and high FGF2 expression; and SMARCC2 in SMARCB1 mutated ATRT tumors. In general, the results demonstrate that large functional genetic data sets can be leveraged to identify, validate, and categorize gene dependencies and their associated biomarkers in primary tumor isolates. The results also highlight some of the challenges and limitations of this approach.

GSE18892,Silencing of AEBP1 in U87MG glial cells and Chip-chIP with AEBP1 antibody,16244," AEBP1 has been identified as a transcriptional repressor playing a significant role in adipogenesis. Recently, we have found that AEBP1 is specifically upregulated in primary glioblastoma. We have used gene silencing to identify genes perturbed upon AEBP1 downregulation and ChIP-chip technique to identify its genomic targets of binding and regulation to understand the un-annotated/undescribed role of this transcription factor in gliomagenesis.

GSE222045,Differential diagnosis between uterine leiomyoma and leiomyosarcoma using transcriptome analysis,36057," Objective: The objective of this study was to estimate the accuracy of transcriptome-based classifier in differential diagnosis of uterine leiomyoma and leiomyosarcoma. Methods: We manually selected 114 normal uterine tissue and 31 leiomyosarcoma samples from publicly available transcriptome data in UCSC Xena as training/validation sets. We developed pre-processing procedure and gene selection method to sensitively find genes of larger variance in leiomyosarcoma than normal uterine tissues. Through our method, twenty genes were selected to build transcriptome-based classifier. The prediction accuracies of deep feedforward neural network (DNN), support vector machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF), and Gradient Boosting (GB) models were examined. We interpret the biological functionality of selected genes via network-based analysis using Gene-Mania. To validate the performance of trained model, we additionally collected 35 clinical samples of leiomyosarcoma and leiomyoma as a test set (18 + 17 as 1st and 2nd test sets). Results: We discovered genes expressed in a highly variable way in leiomyosarcoma while these genes are expressed in a conserved way in normal uterine samples. These genes were mainly associated with DNA replication, cell cycle, and DNA damage checkpoint. Among evaluated machine learning classifiers, the DNN had the highest accuracy and average AUC value in training data set. As gene selection and model training were made in leiomyosarcoma and uterine normal tissue, proving discriminant of ability between leiomyosarcoma and leiomyoma is necessary. Thus, further validation of trained model was conducted in newly collected clinical samples of leiomyosarcoma and leiomyoma. The DNN classifier performed AUC of 0.917 and 0.914 supporting that the selected genes in conjunction with DNN classifier are well discriminating the difference between leiomyosarcoma and leiomyoma in clinical sample. Conclusion: The transcriptome-based classifier accurately distinguished uterine leiomyoma from leiomyosarcoma.

GSE211272,ATR inhibition using gartisertib enhances cell death and synergises with temozolomide and radiation in patient-derived glioblastoma cell lines,35394," Glioblastoma is an aggressive and highly invasive disease that often resists treatment. Tumour cells can restrict the DNA-damaging effects of temozolomide (TMZ) and radiation therapy (RT) using the DNA damage response (DDR) mechanism which activates cell cycle arrest and DNA repair pathways. Ataxia-telangiectasia and Rad3-Related protein (ATR) plays a pivotal role in the recognition of DNA damage induced by chemotherapy and radiation and downstream activation of DDR pathways. Furthermore, a growing body of evidence indicates DNA damage and inhibition of ATR can stimulate a proinflammatory response that activates innate immunity against tumour cells. Here, we investigated the change of gene expression of treated glioblastoma cell lines from TMZ+RT and ATR inhibition (using gartisertib (M4344)) combined with TMZ+RT.

GSE31552,Expression Data from human Lung tissue of Patients with Non Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC),5342,"Lung cancers are a heterogeneous group of diseases with respect to biology and clinical behavior. Currently, diagnosis and classification are based on histological morphology and immunohistological methods for discrimination between two main histologic groups: small cell lung cancer (SCLC) and non-small cell lung cancer which account for 20% and 80% of lung carcinomas, respectively. NSCLCs, which are divided into the three major subtypes adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma and dedifferentiated large cell carcinoma, show different characteristics such as the expression of certain keratins or production of mucin and lack of neuroedocrine differentiation. The molecular pathogenesis of lung cancer involves the accumulation of genetic und epigenetic alterations including the activation of proto-oncogenes and inactivation of tumor suppressor genes which are different for lung cancer subgroups. The development of microarray technologies opened up the possibility to quantify the expression of a large number of genes simultaneously in a given sample. There are several recent reports on expression profiling on lung cancers but the analysis interpretation of the results might be difficult because of the heterogeneity of cellular components. The methods used for sample selection and processing can have a strong influence on the expression values obtained through microarray profiling. Laser capture microdissection (LCM) provides higher specificity in the selection of target cells compared to traditional bulk tissue selection methods, but at an increased processing cost. Here we describe the use of an expression microarray study on NSCLC samples and surrounding tissue, comparing macroscopic lung tumor and tissue samples (“grind and bind”), versus tumor and alveolar compartment cells laser capture microdissected (LCM) from the same macroscopic lung samples. In this study, an initial set of 16 pairs of macroscopic tumor and non-tumor samples (9 pairs squamous-cell carcinoma, 7 pairs adenocarcinoma) was selected for bulk/macro sampling. Of these 16 pairs, 12 pairs were reanalyzed using laser capture microdissection (LCM) for sampling the cells (7 pairs squamous, 5 pairs adenocarcinomas). For macroscopic samples, 50 to 80 µg of tissue was used to isolate total RNA. Gene expression profile was determined using Affymetrix Human Genome Gene 1.0 ST genechip.  For the LCM samples, from representative slides histologically confirmed and mapped by a pathologist, approximately 1000 cells/sample were collected by LCM. cDNA was amplified using Nugen WT-Ovation One-Direct amplification system. In order to validate Nugen amplification bias of WT-Ovation One-Direct amplification system, the total RNA samples of 10 pairs of macroscopic tumor and non-tumor samples were amplified with this amplification system, and their cDNA was used to microarray.

GSE201657,Epigenetic-focused CRISPR/Cas9 screen identifies ASH2L as a regulator of glioblastoma cell survival,31657," Glioblastoma is the most common and aggressive primary brain tumor with dismal prognosis, highlighting an urgent need for novel treatment strategies. In this study, we investigated epigenetic regulators of glioblastoma cell survival through CRISPR/Cas9 based genetic ablation screens using our customized sgRNA library EpiDoKOL, which targets critical functional domains of chromatin modifiers. Screens conducted in multiple cell lines revealed ASH2L, a histone lysine methyltransferase complex subunit, as a major regulator of glioblastoma cell viability.  ASH2L depletion led to cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. RNA sequencing and Cut&Run sequencing together identified a set of cell cycle regulatory genes, such as TRA2B, BARD1, KIF20B, ARID4A, SMARCC1 that were downregulated upon ASH2L depletion. Mass spectrometry analysis demonstrated the interaction partners of ASH2L in glioblastoma cell lines as COMPASS family members including SETD1A, SETD1B, MLL1 and MLL2, however glioblastoma cells had differential dependency to COMPASS members for survival. The growth of ASH2L-depleted glioblastoma cells was markedly slower than controls in orthotopic in vivo models. TCGA analysis showed high ASH2L expression in glioblastoma compared to low grade gliomas and immunohistochemical analysis revealed significant ASH2L expression in glioblastoma tissues, attesting to its clinical relevance. Therefore, high throughput, robust and affordable screens with focused libraries, such as EpiDoKOL, holds great promise to enable rapid discovery of novel epigenetic regulators of cancer cell survival, such as ASH2L. Together, we suggest that targeting ASH2L could serve as a new therapeutic opportunity for glioblastoma.

GSE29158,RNA-sequence analysis of human B-cells,6244,"RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) allows quantitative measurement of expression levels of genes and their transcripts. In this study, we sequenced complementary DNA fragments of cultured human B-cells and obtained 879 million 50-bp reads comprising 44 Gb of sequence. The results allowed us to study the gene expression profile of B-cells and to determine experimental parameters for sequencing-based expression studies. We identified 20,766 genes and 67,453 of their alternatively spliced transcripts. More than 90% of the genes with multiple exons are alternatively spliced; for most genes, one isoform is predominantly expressed. We found that while chromosomes differ in gene density, the percentage of transcribed genes in each chromosome is less variable. In addition, genes involved in related biological processes are expressed at more similar levels than genes with different functions. Besides characterizing gene expression, we also used the data to investigate the effect of sequencing depth on gene expression measurements. While 100 million reads are sufficient to detect most expressed genes and transcripts, about 500 million reads are needed to measure accurately their expression levels. We provide examples in which deep sequencing is needed to determine the relative abundance of genes and their isoforms. With data from 20 individuals and about 40 million sequence reads per sample, we uncovered only 21 alternatively spliced, multi-exon genes that are not in databases; this result suggests that at this sequence coverage, we can detect most of the known genes. Results from this project are available on the UCSC Genome Browser to allow readers to study the expression and structure of genes in human B-cells.

GSE236253,3D gene regulation network in glioma ferroptosis,31729," Erastin is a small molecular compound which inhibits the system Xc- and prevents the import of cystine, reducing glutathione (GSH) biosynthesis and glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) activity, and finally inducing cell death via ferroptosis. To establish a model of Erastin induced ferroptosis in glioma cells, U87 cells were treated of Erastin (10 μM, 72 h). Combination analysis of HiChIP, ChIP-seq and RNA-seq data suggests that change of chromatin loops mediated by 3D chromatin structure regulate gene expressions in glioma ferroptosis. Genes that regulated by 3D chromatin structure include genes that were reported function in ferroptosis like MDM2 and TXRND1. We propose a new regulatory mechanism governing glioma cell ferroptosis by 3D chromatin structure.

While many studies highlight the significance of teneurins, especially during development, there is only limited information known about the molecular mechanisms of function. Previous studies have shown that the N-terminal intracellular domain (ICD) of teneurins can be cleaved at the membrane and subsequently translocates to the nucleus where it can influence gene transcription. Target genes as well as mechanisms have yet to be elucidated, and thus we are investigating the transcriptional activity of the human teneurin-1 ICD in this study.

GSE230661.2,Uncovering transcriptomic landscape alterations of CAN-2409 in in vitro and in vivo glioma models - Homo sapiens,32939," Rationale: CAN-2409 is a locally delivered oncolytic therapy, which results in vaccination against the injected tumor. CAN-2409  consists of a non-replicating adenovirus armed with the Herpes virus thymidine kinase, which metabolizes ganciclovir into a phosphorylated nucleotide that is incorporated into the tumor cell’s genome, thereby inflicting immunogenic cancer cell death. While CAN-2409’s immunological impact has been well characterized, its effects on the tumor cells transcriptome remains unknown. We compared the transcriptomic landscape after treatment of glioblastoma models with CAN-2409 in vitro and in vivo to assess how the interplay with the tumor microenvironment influences CAN-2409-mediated transcriptome alterations.  Methods: We performed RNA-Seq with CAN-2409 treated patient-derived glioma stem-like cells and tumors of C57/BL6 mice and compared KEGG pathway usage and differential gene expression focusing on immune cell and cytokine profiles. T-cell -killing assays were performed to assess candidate effectors.  Results: PCA analysis showed distinct clustering of control and CAN-2409 samples under both conditions. KEGG pathway analysis revealed significant enrichment for p53 signaling and cell cycle pathway, with similar dynamics for key regulators of both pathways in vitro and in vivo, including MYC, CCNB1, PLK1 and CDC20. Cytokine expression analysis revealed upregulation of pro-inflammatory IL12a under both conditions; immune cell gene profiling showed reduction of myeloid associated genes. T-cell- killing assays showed increased killing in the presence of IL-12.  Conclusion: CAN-2409 significantly alters the transcriptome both in vitro and in vivo. Comparison of pathway enrichment revealed mutual and differential utilization of pathways under both conditions, suggesting a modulating influence on the cell cycle in tumor cells, and of the tumor microenvironment on the transcriptome in vivo. IL-12 synthesis likely depends on interactions with the tumor microenvironment, and it facilitates CAN-2409 cell killing. This dataset provides potential to understand resistance mechanisms and identify potential biomarkers for future studies.

GSE224692,The Oligostilbene Gnetin-H is a Novel Glycolysis Inhibitor that Regulates Thioredoxin Interacting Protein Expression and Synergizes with OXPHOS Inhibitor in Cancer Cells,33218," Since aerobic glycolysis has been first observed in tumors almost a century ago by Otto Warburg, the field of cancer cell metabolism sparked the interest of scientists around the world as it might offer new avenues of treatments for malignant cells.  Our current study claims the discovery of Gnetin-H (GH) as a novel glycolysis inhibitor that can decrease metabolic activity and lactic acid synthesis and displays a strong cytostatic effect in melanoma and glioblastoma cells.  Compared to most of the other glycolysis inhibitors used in combination with the complex-1 mitochondrial inhibitor Phenformin, GH more potently inhibited cell growth. RNA-Seq with the T98G glioblastoma cell line treated with GH showed more than an 80-fold reduction in Thioredoxin Interacting Protein (TXNIP) expression indicating that GH has a direct effect in regulating a key gene involved in the homeostasis of cellular glucose. GH in combination with Phenformin also substantially enhanced levels of p-AMPK, a marker of metabolic catastrophe. These findings suggest that the concurrent use of the glycolytic inhibitor GH with a complex-1 mitochondrial inhibitor could be used as a powerful tool to induce metabolic catastrophe in cancer cells and reduce their growth.

GSE163044,Regional identity of human neural stem cells determines oncogenic responses to histone H3.3 mutants [RNA-Seq],34250," Point mutations within the histone H3.3 are frequent in aggressive childhood brain tumours known as paediatric high-grade gliomas (pHGGs). Intriguingly, different mutations arise in discrete anatomical regions: H3.3-G34R within the forebrain and H3.3-K27M preferentially within the hindbrain. The reasons for this contrasting aetiology are unknown. By engineering human foetal neural stem cell cultures from distinct regions, we demonstrate here that cell-intrinsic regional identity provides differential responsiveness to each mutant that mirrors the origins of pHGGs. Focusing on H3.3-G34R, we find that the oncohistone supports proliferation of forebrain cells, while inducing a cytostatic response in the hindbrain. Mechanistically, H3.3-G34R does not impose widespread transcriptional or epigenetic changes, but impairs recruitment of ZMYND11, a transcriptional repressor of highly expressed genes. We therefore propose that H3.3-G34R promotes tumorigenesis by stabilising the expression of key progenitor genes and, thus, locking initiating forebrain cells into their preexisting immature state.

GSE35603,Network Biology of Tumor Stem-like Cells Identified a Regulatory Role of CBX5 in Lung Cancer,7636,"Mounting evidence points to a link between a cancer possessing stem-like properties and a worse prognosis. To understand the biology, a common approach is to integrate network biology with signal processing mechanics. That said, even with the right tools, predicting the risk for a highly susceptible target using only a handful of gene signatures remains very difficult. By compiling the expression profiles of a panel of tumor stem-like cells (TSLCs) originating in different tissues, comparing these to their parental tumor cells (PTCs) and the human embryonic stem cells (hESCs), and integrating network analysis with signaling mechanics, we propose that network topologically-weighted signaling processing measurements under tissue-specific conditions can provide scalable and predicable target identification. All function codes related to this project could be accessed at the supplementary website.

GSE45921,Expression data from human glioma tissues,8088,"Gliomas are aggressive lethal solid brain tumors arising from support cells in the central nervous system. Despite intense efforts to optimize the treatment of gliomas, the outcomes of high grade glioma patients are still frustrating. The causes and progress of gliomas have been investigated extensively; however, the genetic factors involved in the development of this disease remain poorly understood. We used microarrays to detail the global program of gene expression in different grade glioma tissues and try to find out some genes associated with the tumorigenesis of gliomas.

GSE60530,"Profile of gene expression in U87-MG xenografts expressing control vector (V0), the ubiquitin ligase KPC1 or the p50 subunit of the NF-kB transcription factor, using RNASeq analysis of transcripts mapped independently to the human and murine genomes",9402,"Purpose: We identified KPC1 as the ubiquitin ligase that binds to the p105 precursor of NF-kB, ubiquitinates it and mediates its proteasomal processing to generate the p50 active subunit of the transcription factor. Using U87-MG human glioblastoma xenografts, we observed that overexpression of KPC1 results in strong inhibition of tumor growth mediated via excessive generation of p50.The goal of this RNASeq study was to analyze the profile of gene expression in xenografts overexpressing control (V0), KPC1 or p50 vectors, and to further understand how the altered gene expression patterns can explain the tumor suppressive effect we observed. Results:Transcript analysis of U87-MG xenografts overexpressing control (V0), KPC1 or p50 vector mapped  to the human genome  revealed: • A strong similarity between overexpression of p50 and KPC1 (correlation of 0.51, p-value<10-300 ) • A specific signature of NF-kB targets [21 of the consistently changed genes are known to be regulated by NF-kB (p-value<3.4×10-9 )] • A significant (p-value<1.4×10-18) increase in the expression of 40 tumor suppressor genes, with no significant change in other classes. • A significant down regulation of a cluster of genes including LIN28B, IL-6, HMAGA2 and VEGFA. This finding links well to an established regulatory axis involving LIN28B, Let-7 microRNA, and IL-6 in inflammation and cell transformation that is regulated by NF-kB.

GSE250617,GQIcombi application to subdue glioma via differentiation therapy,35200," Modern therapy approaches fail to prevent high grade glioma recurrence. So, alternative ways need to be developed. Changing glioma cells’ fate is an alternative way to prevent tumor growth. Two-step protocol based on an antiproliferative G-quadruplex and small molecules triggering neural differentiation showed to be effective on glioblastoma cell cultures. This approach was named a differential therapy. In this paper, we broaden the spectrum of cell cultures to gliomas of II, III and IV grades, showing the universality of suggested protocol on a variety of cancer cells. We checked the reasonability of consistent addition of factors to the glioma cells. Moreover, we demonstrated a significant inhibition of tumor growth after injection of GQIcombi into 101/8 tumor in glioma rat model. Thus, the proposed strategy of influencing on cancer cell growth is applicable to be further translated for therapy use.

GSE253222,Modular Tissue-in-a-CUBE platform to model blood-brain barrier (BBB) and brain interaction,35492," With the advent of increasingly sophisticated organoids, there is growing demand for technology to replicate the interactions between multiple tissues or organs. This is challenging to achieve, however, due to the varying culture conditions of the different cell types that make up each tissue. Current methods often require complicated microfluidic setups, but fragile tissue samples tend not to fare well with rough handling. Furthermore, the more complicated the human system to be replicated, the more difficult the model becomes to operate. Here, we present the development of a multi-tissue chip platform that takes advantage of the modularity and convenient handling ability of a CUBE device. We first developed a blood-brain barrier-in-a-CUBE by layering astrocytes, pericytes, and brain microvascular endothelial cells in the CUBE, and confirmed the expression and function of important tight junction and transporter proteins in the blood-brain barrier model. Then, we demonstrated the application of integrating Tissue-in-a-CUBE with a chip in simulating the in vitro testing of the permeability of a drug through the blood-brain barrier to the brain and its effect on treating the glioblastoma brain cancer model. We anticipate that this platform can be adapted for use with organoids to build complex human systems in vitro by the combination of multiple simple CUBE units.

GSE24716,Expression data from CD133+ and CD133- glioma cells,4011,"Given the very substantial heterogeneity of most human cancers, it is likely that most cancer therapeutics will be active in only a small fraction of any population of patients. As such, the development of new therapeutics, coupled with methods to match a therapy with the individual patient, will be critical to achieving significant gains in disease outcome. One such opportunity is the use of expression signatures to identify key oncogenic phenotypes that can serve not only as biomarkers but also as a means of identifying therapeutic compounds that might specifically target these phenotypes. Given the potential importance of targeting tumors exhibiting a stem-like phenotype, we have developed an expression signature that reflects common biological aspects of various stem-like characteristics.  The Consensus Stemness Ranking (CSR) signature is upregulated in cancer stem cell enriched samples, at advanced tumor stages and is associated with poor prognosis in multiple cancer types. Using two independent computational approaches we utilized the CSR signature to identify clinically useful compounds that could target the CSR phenotype. In vitro assays confirmed selectivity of several predicted compounds including topoisomerase inhibitors and resveratrol towards breast cancer cell lines that exhibit a high-CSR phenotype. Importantly, the CSR signature could predict clinical response of breast cancer patients to a neoadjuvant regimen that included a CSR-specific agent.  Collectively, these results suggest therapeutic opportunities to target the CSR phenotype in a relevant cohort of cancer patients.

GSE43730,A Myc transcriptional program that is independent of EMT drives a poor prognosis tumor-propagating phenotype in HER2+ breast cancer,7023,"The HER2 (ERBB2) and MYC genes are commonly amplified genes in breast cancer, yet little is known about their molecular and clinical interaction. Using a novel chimeric mammary transgenic approach and in vitro models, we demonstrate markedly increased self renewal and tumour propagating capability of cells transformed with Her2 and c-Myc. Co-expression of both oncogenes in cultured cells led to a pronounced activation of a c-Myc transcriptional signature and acquisition of a self renewing phenotype independent of an EMT programme or regulation of cancer stem cell markers. We show that HER2 and c-MYC are frequently co-amplified in a clinical breast cancer cohort and that co-amplification is strongly associated with aggressive clinical behaviour and poor outcome. Lastly, we show that in patients receiving adjuvant chemotherapy (but not targeted anti-HER2 therapy), MYC amplification is associated with a poor outcome in HER2+ breast cancer patients. These findings demonstrate the importance of molecular context in oncogenic transformation and acquisition of a malignant stem-like phenotype and have important diagnostic and therapeutic consequences for the clinical management of HER2+ breast cancer.

GSE76814,ECT2 and AURKB Modulate Formation of Stress Granules Containing Transcripts from Diverse Cellular Pathways in Astrocytoma Cells,9375,"Stress granules are small RNA-protein granules that modify the translational landscape during cellular stress to promote survival. The RhoGTPase RhoA is implicated in the formation of RNA stress granules.  Our data demonstrate that the cytokinetic proteins ECT2 and AurkB are localized to stress granules in human astrocytoma cells.  AurkB and its downstream target histone-3 are phosphorylated during arsenite-induced stress. Chemical (AZD1152-HQPA) and siRNA inhibition of AurkB results in fewer and smaller stress granules when analyzed utilizing high throughput fluorescent based cellomics assays. RNA immunoprecipitation with the known stress granule aggregates TIAR and G3BP1 was performed on astrocytoma cells and subsequent analysis revealed that astrocytoma stress granules harbour unique mRNAs for various cellular pathways including cellular migration, metabolism, translation and transcriptional regulation.  Human astrocytoma cell stress granules contain mRNA that are known to be involved in glioma signaling and the mTOR pathway. These data provide evidence that RNA stress granules are a novel form of epigenetic regulation in astrocytoma cells, which may be targetable by chemical inhibitors and enhance astrocytoma susceptiblity to conventional therapy such as radiation and chemotherapy.

GSE218668,Epigenetic marks elucidate gene regulatory elements require for human inhibitory interneuron-like progenitors,27654," Gene regulatory elements such as enhancers dynamically regulate gene expression in a tissue-specific manner. However, the transcriptional regulatory elements during human inhibitory interneuron differentiation and their role in neurodevelopmental disorders are unknown. Here, we generate gene regulatory element maps of human inhibitory-like interneurons derived from embryonic stem cells (H9-ESC), permitting large-scale annotation of previously uncharacterized regulatory elements relevant to inhibitory interneuron differentiation. Our analyses identify neuronal progenitor enhancers that likely regulate the expression of transcription factors that are essential for interneuron differentiation. Focusing on dynamic changes in chromatin organization, FOXG1 and ZEB2, where the chromatin organization is changed in interneuron progenitors compared to different stages during the differentiation. Using 4C-seq and an in vivo enhancer assay, we characterized neuronal enhancers at the FOXG1 locus that interact with the FOXG1 promoter region and showed activity patterns that resemble FOXG1 expression. Using CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing, we deleted FOXG1 enhancer/s that reduced FOXG1 expression in glioblastoma cells and altered cell proliferation. Furthermore, a microdeletion proximal to FOXG1 encompassing these neuronal FOXG1 enhancers was found in a patient with Rett-like syndrome, supporting the role of FOXG1 enhancers in this syndrome. Thus, our study elucidates the gene regulatory networks of human inhibitory interneurons. Furthermore, it provides a framework for understanding the impact of non-coding regulatory elements during inhibitory interneuron differentiation, and highlights novel mechanisms underlying neurodevelopmental disorders.

In return, host cells activate multiple signaling pathways to limit viral replication and eradicate viruses. The present study explores the complex interplay between viruses and their host cells through next generation RNA sequencing. The coding transcriptome of human brain-derived U87 cells infected with Kunjin virus, Zika virus, or Yellow Fever virus were compared to the transcriptome of mock-infected cells. Changes in the abundance of several hundred mRNAs were found in each infection. Moreover, the alternative splicing of hundreds of mRNAs was found to be modulated upon viral infection.

GSE133285,Transcriptional profiling of SF295 cells following MTF1 knockout by CRISPR/Cas9,33309," SF295 glioblastoma cells were subjected to CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knockout of the MTF1 (metal regulatory transcription factor 1) gene or non-targeted control (GFP). Two guides targeting MTF1 and one guide targeting GFP were cloned into the pXPR_023 all-in-one CRISPR/Cas9 vector. SF295 cells were transduced by lentiviral infection and selected using puromycin. Following selection, RNA was harvested from cell lines growing in culture. Wild-type SF295 cells were also included as a control. Anti-cancer uses of non-oncology drugs have been found on occasion, but such discoveries have been serendipitous and rare. To fully discover activity against multiple tumor types, resource-intensive screening across hundreds of cancer cell lines is needed. We sought to create a public resource containing the growth inhibitory activity of 4,518 drugs tested across 578 human cancer cell lines. To accomplish this, we used PRISM, which involves the molecular barcoding of each cell line, followed by pooling of the barcoded lines. Relative barcode abundance following drug treatment versus controls thus reflects cell viability following drug treatment. We found that an unexpectedly large number of non-oncology drugs selectively inhibited subsets of cancer cell lines. Moreover, the killing activity of the majority of these drugs was predictable based on the molecular features of the cell lines. Mechanistic follow-up of several of these compounds revealed novel mechanisms. These results illustrate the potential of the PRISM drug repurposing resource as a starting point for new oncology therapeutic development.

GSE52707,Nuclear factor kappa B activation-induced anti-apoptosis renders HER2 positive cells drug resistant and accelerates tumor growth,34532," Breast cancers with HER2 overexpression are sensitive to drugs targeting the receptor or its kinase activity. HER2-targeting drugs are initially effective against HER2- positive breast cancer, but resistance inevitably occurs. We previously found that nuclear factor kappa B is hyper-activated in the subset of HER-2 positive breast cancer cells and tissue specimens. In this study, we report that constitutively active NF-κB rendered HER2-positive cancer cells resistant to anti-HER2 drugs, and cells selected for Lapatinib resistance up-regulated NF-κB. In both circumstances, cells were anti-apoptotic and grew rapidly as xenografts. Lapatinib-resistant cells were refractory to HER2 and NF-κB inhibitors alone but were sensitive to their combination, suggesting a novel therapeutic strategy. A subset of NF-κB-responsive genes was overexpressed in HER2-positive and triple-negative breast cancers, and patients with this NF-κB signature had poor clinical outcome. Anti-HER2 drug resistance may be a consequence of NF-κB activation, and selection for resistance results in NF-κB activation, suggesting this transcription factor is central to oncogenesis and drug resistance. Clinically, the combined targeting of HER2 and NF-κB suggests a potential treatment paradigm for patients who relapse after anti-HER2 therapy. Patients with these cancers may be treated by simultaneously suppressing HER2 signaling and NF-κB activation. We used microarrays to detail the gene expression differences underlying the characterictic survival differences between the SKR6, SKR6-Vector, SKR6CA, and SKR6LR cell lines, which are defined as follows: SKR6: A clonal derivative of SKBR3 cells isolated by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) to enrich for elevated HER2 levels, SKR6CA: SKR6 cells retrovirally transduced with constitutively active NF-κB relA/p65 (CAp65) and selected with puromycin, SKR6 vector: SKR6 cells transduced with the pQCXIP empty retroviral vector and selected with puromycin, and SKR6LR: SKR6 cells treated with increasing lapatinib concentrations (0.2 to 5 μM) for several months.

In this study, we reveal a bivalent function of a super-enhancer RNA LINC02454 in modulating glioma cell sensitivity to TMZ via regulation of SORBS2 and DDR expression. LINC02454 increased TMZ sensitivity by maintaining 3D chromatin structure and promoting SORBS2 expression, but paradoxically decreased TMZ sensitivity by binding to the DDR1 locus and promoting DDR1 transcription. This study proposes a new regulatory mechanism governing glioma cell sensitivity to TMZ and provides new insights that may improve therapies against glioma.

This study highlights the distinct impact of a specific pulsed electric field protocol named PEF-5 (0.3 MV/m, 40 µs, 5 pulses) on astrocytes (NHA), medulloblastoma (D283) and gli-oblastoma (U87 NS) cancer stem-like cells. We pursued this goal performing ultrastructural analyses corroborated by molecular/omics approaches to understand the vulnerability or re-sistance mechanisms triggered by PEF-5 exposure in the different cell types. Electron microscopic analyses showed that, independently of exposed cells, the main targets of PEF-5 were the cell membrane and the cytoskeleton, presenting indiscriminate filopodia disappearance on the cell surface accompanied by a rapid cell swelling. Nevertheless, cells activated different responses stemming from intracellular organelles. NHA triggered a protective mechanism to recover from the damaged membranes and eliminated the detrimental ROS to maintain cell vital functions. Conversely, PEF-5 induced a different action on mitochondria of cancer stem-like cells, more prominent on D283 compared to U87 NS cells, in correlation with a higher basal level of CD133 protein in D283 cells. In this case, a complete mitochondrial dysfunction was demonstrated, inhibiting the recovery of D283 vital processes, while a mild perturbation was observed in mito-chondria of U87 NS cells, not sufficient to impair their cell functions. Altogether, these results suggest the possibility to use PEF-based technology as a novel strategy to target selectively mi-tochondria of CSCs, preserving healthy cells. Ultrastructural analysis, supported by transcriptomic characterization in microsecond pulsed electric field exposed normal brain and brain tumor cells
