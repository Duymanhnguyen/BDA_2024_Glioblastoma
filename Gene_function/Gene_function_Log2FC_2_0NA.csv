Mouse studies found a decrease of mRNA levels of this gene after ovulation was induced. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants. [provided by RefSeq, Jun 2014]"
"59","1730","DIAPH2","diaphanous related formin 2","X","Xq21.33","Homo sapiens","human","The product of this gene belongs to the diaphanous subfamily of the formin homology family of proteins. This gene may play a role in the development and normal function of the ovaries. Defects in this gene have been linked to premature ovarian failure 2. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been identified. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]"
"60","147495","APCDD1","APC down-regulated 1","18","18p11.22","Homo sapiens","human","This locus encodes an inhibitor of the Wnt signaling pathway. Mutations at this locus have been associated with hereditary hypotrichosis simplex. Increased expression of this gene may also be associated with colorectal carcinogenesis.[provided by RefSeq, Sep 2010]"
"61","4504","MT3","metallothionein 3","16","16q13","Homo sapiens","human","This gene is a member of the metallothionein family of genes. Proteins encoded by this gene family are low in molecular weight, are cysteine-rich, lack aromatic residues, and bind divalent heavy metal ions. This gene family member displays tissue-specific expression, and contains a threonine insert near its N-terminus and a glutamate-rich hexapeptide insert near its C-terminus relative to the proteins encoded by other gene family members. It plays an important role in zinc and copper homeostasis, and is induced under hypoxic conditions. The encoded protein is a growth inhibitory factor, and reduced levels of the protein are observed in the brains of individuals with some metal-linked neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease.

Predicted to be involved in positive regulation of peptidase activity. Predicted to act upstream of or within cellular response to leukemia inhibitory factor. Predicted to be located in extracellular region. [provided by Alliance of Genome Resources, Apr 2022]"
"63","5122","PCSK1","proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 1","5","5q15","Homo sapiens","human","This gene encodes a member of the subtilisin-like proprotein convertase family, which includes proteases that process protein and peptide precursors trafficking through regulated or constitutive branches of the secretory pathway. The encoded protein undergoes an initial autocatalytic processing event in the ER to generate a heterodimer which exits the ER and sorts to subcellular compartments where a second autocatalytic even takes place and the catalytic activity is acquired. The protease is packaged into and activated in dense core secretory granules and expressed in the neuroendocrine system and brain. This gene encodes one of the seven basic amino acid-specific members which cleave their substrates at single or paired basic residues. It functions in the proteolytic activation of polypeptide hormones and neuropeptides precursors. Mutations in this gene have been associated with susceptibility to obesity and proprotein convertase 1/3 deficiency. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding multiple isoforms have been observed for this gene [provided by RefSeq, Jan 2014]"
"64","26022","TMEM98","transmembrane protein 98","17","17q11.2","Homo sapiens","human","This gene encodes a transmembrane protein. A missense mutation in this gene result in Nanophthalmos 4 (NNO4).

"65","22915","MMRN1","multimerin 1","4","4q22.1","Homo sapiens","human"," Multimerin is a massive, soluble protein found in platelets and in the endothelium of blood vessels.  It is comprised of subunits linked by interchain disulfide bonds to form large, variably sized homomultimers.  Multimerin is a factor V/Va-binding protein and may function as a carrier protein for platelet factor V.  It may also have functions as an extracellular matrix or adhesive protein.  Recently, patients with an unusual autosomal-dominant bleeding disorder (factor V Quebec) were found to have a deficiency of platelet multimerin. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]"
"66","2890","GRIA1","glutamate ionotropic receptor AMPA type subunit 1","5","5q33.2","Homo sapiens","human","Glutamate receptors are the predominant excitatory neurotransmitter receptors in the mammalian brain and are activated in a variety of normal neurophysiologic processes. These receptors are heteromeric protein complexes with multiple subunits, each possessing transmembrane regions, and all arranged to form a ligand-gated ion channel. The classification of glutamate receptors is based on their activation by different pharmacologic agonists. This gene belongs to a family of alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionate (AMPA) receptors. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]"
